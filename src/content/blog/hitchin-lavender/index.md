Hitchin is a small town in Hertfordshire, around 50 km north of London. The _pretty_ town centre boasts cobbled streets, fantastic independent cafes, a _one thousand year old_ church and a market square that hosts a variety of interesting events.

Just outside the centre though is Hitchin’s most popular attraction, one that draws in day tripping tourists from _all over the world_. That attraction is **Hitchin Lavender**.

In this post, we’ll tell the story of our most recent visit to Hitchin Lavender, before then going on to tell you how you can visit yourself.

## Enjoying the sights & smells at Hitchin Lavender

Jade and I live a short drive away from the lavender fields, so we try to visit at least once a year to soak in the **tranquil atmosphere** and to enjoy the _sea of purple flowers_. We always try to coincide our visit with the best blooming time, which is normally _late June to mid-July_ and sure enough, we were there at just the right time.

Word had seemingly spread and we were joined by a _hundreds_ of fellow lavender fans keen to experience this **stunning, colourful** natural show. Visitors strolled through the long stems, taking deep breathes of the _sweet, herbal aroma_ and running their hands over the sturdy flower tips. Despite the numbers, the fields were a **tranquil, happy place**. Some had brought a picnic and blankets and had set themselves up for the day around the field’s periphery.

The visitors weren’t alone. Thousands of bees, _hypnotised_ by the purple radiance were busily flying from bloom to bloom collecting nectar.

## Help yourself to as much Lavender as you can carry

The _wonderful_ and _unique_ thing about visiting Hitchin Lavender (apart from the jaw-dropping scenes) is that you can **harvest as much of it as you like**.

For an extra £4, you can claim a paper bag which you can then fill up with cuttings. We dutifully _snipped away_, not really knowing what we were going to do with our freshly collected purple loot, but enjoying it all the same.

Others were making immediate use of their spoils, fashioning _elaborate headdresses_ and bouquets on the spot. Most though, like us, were content with selectively harvesting the best blooms and worrying about what to do with them all later.

## Plan & Book your visit to Hitchin Lavender

Ready to visit Hitchin Lavender? Here's some essential information on how to visit.

### Getting to Hitchin Lavender by car

The lavender fields are outside the town centre, so getting there by car is the easiest and best option. There’s plenty of free on-site parking.

### How to visit Hitchin Lavender from London

Day-tripping from London by train is really easy! Thameslink and Great Northern services call at Hitchin, departing from London Kings Cross and St Pancras International all day, every day.

Both stations are across the road from one another. If you’re not sure which service you’re taking, head to Kings Cross first as departures from St Pancras International are displayed on the electronic boards alongside those from Kings Cross.

You can buy your tickets from vending machines at the station right before travel or you can buy them in advance online. Buying in advance can bring down the cost of your fare, so if you’re certain about when you’re visiting, it’s definitely worth checking the prices before you go.

To check train times and fare options, [we recommend Trainline](https://go.skimresources.com?id=85974X1563631&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetrainline.com%2Ftrain-times%2Flondon-to-hitchin).

Upon arrival at Hitchin station, you’ll find a taxi rank outside the entrance. Make sure you grab a business card or a phone number from the driver so that you can call them to collect you when you’re ready to head back to the station. If you forget, staff at Hitchin Lavender will be able to help you out.

Alternatively, Uber drivers are increasingly operating in the area, so it’s worth checking your app to see if anyone’s close by. Uber rates are normally cheaper than regular taxis.

### When is the best time to visit?

Flowering is obviously weather dependent, but the main field is normally looking its most photogenic from late June to Mid-July. Blooms typically last until August. The [official Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hitchinlavender/) account is normally a good place to check how things are developing.

## Why not visit Hitchin itself too?

Hitchin is a fabulous place to visit at any time of year. We recommend coupling a visit to Hitchin Lavender with Hitchin itself. The town centre boasts more than its fair share in independent cafes, restaurants and shops and the pretty, cobbled streets are lovely to explore.
