After several months of work, we’re delighted to present our brand new website. Pssst! You’re looking at it right now! Yay!

We’ve also renamed ourselves - we’re now Giveback Guide (because everyone seemed to think that’s what our name was anyway).

## Why build a new website?

Our original website was built very quickly using Wordpress. Wordpress powers around 40% of all websites on the Internet. While it’s a great tool and completely free to use, adding extra functionality does usually come at a cost. 

We have big plans for our platform and we could see already that making those plans a reality would become expensive very quickly.

Additionally, publishing new projects was taking far too long. We were running two separate databases. It was a pain!

## What are the benefits of our new website?

Our new website brings multiple benefits for both you and our team. Here’s the lowdown;

- **Faster project publishing:** No more complicated data migrations for us. We can now publish projects super fast!
- **Really, really fast:** Our new website is running on a web development framework called [Astro](https://astro.build). Don’t worry, all you need to know is our website now zips along like a gazelle.
- **Better for the planet:** Astro allows us to produce really lightweight code which doesn’t require much computing power. This means we’re using much less electricity (which, by the way, is 100% renewable too).
- **Lower running costs:** Goodbye ever increasing running costs. We’ve slashed our monthly running costs by nearly 100%.
- **Blog posts now baked in:** Our blog is now baked into the main site, rather than being separate. Whoop whoop!
- **Ready for new features:** We’ve laid the foundations for all our future plans, so we’ll be able to bolt on new features much quicker and much more easily.
- **Monetisation:** Eventually, we’d like to cover our running costs and (dare we say it) earn a wage from our platform. We’ve now added ways for us to start making money, including discrete text-based ads from handpicked ethical businesses.

## We’re still working on some stuff

There’s still some stuff we’re not entirely happy about that we’re continuing to work on. They are;

- **Search:** The new search box is not quite right. It’s quick, but it’s a but funky in places. We’re working to fix it as a priority.
- **Filters:** We want to add the ability for you to filter long lists of projects down. You can already filter by country and by locale. We’ll add the ability to filter by category sometime in the future.
- **Accessibility:** We want Giveback Guide to be open to all. We’re close to meeting web accessibility standards, but not quite there yet. It’s super important to us and we intend to fix everything soon.
- **Branding:** With our new brand name comes a new logo (well, technically it’s a word mark). We rather like it, but we expect our branding to evolve over time. At some time in the future, we might ask a branding professional to overhaul to whole thing for us. In the meantime, it is what it is.

## What happens next?

Now that our new website is live, we’re good to go on the following priorities;

- **Get through the project backlog:** There are still more unpublished projects than published ones. Our priority is getting through the backlog.
- **Tweaking stuff:** Expect to see lots of small changes on the website over the next few weeks and months while we settle on how we want things to look and how they work.
