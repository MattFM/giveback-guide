Often caught in the shadow of near neighbour Vienna, Bratislava deserves so much more attention from travellers than it currently receives.

For many travellers, it’s a choice between the two and Vienna almost always wins. But with only only 55km (34 miles) of pasture between the two cities and fast, frequent and inexpensive travel options aplenty, we say, [do both!](https://heretotravel.com/vienna-to-bratislava)

In this post, we’ll run through some of the best things to do in Bratislava. Think of each item in our list as a reason to visit and you’ll soon realise that Bratislava doesn’t deserve to be bypassed.

## Our recommended things to do in Bratislava, Slovakia

Let’s now discover why the Slovakian capital is worthy of a place in your travel itinerary by exploring some of best things to do in Bratislava.

### Stroll aimlessly through the pedestrianised Old Town

Bratislava’s Old Town is compact and very easy to explore on foot. One of its highlights is simply wandering the pedestrianised lanes and admiring the architectural mix. The city has had a large number of cultural influences over the centuries, leading to an eclectic blend of baroque palaces, gothic churches and adventurous 20th century constructions.

You can see pretty much all of the Old Town and the surrounding area in a day, so put on some comfortable shoes and get walking.

### Get your bearings at the Old Town Hall

[Go to Website](http://www.muzeum.bratislava.sk/en/)

A good way to start your time in Bratislava is to go up the 13th century clock tower at the Old Town Hall and get an overview of the city. The 70m (230ft) high tower offers a 360° view over the old town and the surrounding neighbourhoods.

From the tower, it’s possible to see many of Bratislava’s main tourism spots, including Bratislava Castle, the UFO bridge and the main square.

### Visit the City History Museum

**Address:** Hlavné námestie 501/1, 811 01 Staré Mesto  
[Go to Website](http://www.muzeum.bratislava.sk/en/)

The _Museum of the City History_ (sic) is housed inside the Old Town Hall and has a series of themed exhibitions that give a good initial overview of Bratislava. As well as artefacts from as old as the neolithic era, there is also an exhibition of torture equipment inside the former dungeons. Visitors can also tour the former meeting and administrative rooms of the Old Town Hall, some of which contain intricate ceiling decoration.

### Seek out street art and statues

For a small city, Bratislava has plenty of street art and statues. The statues in particular are often situated in unusual locations. The most famous of these statues is _Rubberneck_, a bronze bust of a worker emerging from a drain. It’s a popular draw for tourists, so wait your turn in order to get a photo.

As you stroll around, be on the lookout for artwork on the sides of buildings, sticker clusters and statues.

### Enjoy Bratislava’s Cafe Culture

Nearby Vienna is highly and rightly regarded for its cafe culture. Bratislava though is seemingly undaunted by the reputation of its nearby neighbour, providing those seeking cake and coffee plenty to get excited about.

Our favourite cafes were _Five Points_, a cosy and contemporary coffee house and _Dobre&Dobré_, a bohemian cafe with Parisian-style decor. There are though plenty more to choose from, each offering its own style and character.

One bonus the Bratislava has over Vienna is that prices in Slovakia are often cheaper than those in Austria. So sip your coffee smugly, as those just across the border will be paying a bit more than you are.

![The UFO bridge is an unmistakable symbol of the city](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745833079/bratislava-danube-ufo-bridge-1024x683.jpg_vzeilb.webp)

### Visit the UFO Bridge

**Address:** Most SNP 1, 851 01 Petržalka  
[Go to Website](https://www.u-f-o.sk/en/index.html)

Since 1972, a UFO has dominated the skyline of Bratislava. Officially named Most SNP (_Bridge of the Slovak National Uprising_), the bridge would otherwise be just another way of crossing the Danube if it wasn’t for the extra-terrestrial inspired pod at the top of the single pylon.

As well as an observation deck that provides a panoramic view of the entire city, there’s a restaurant at the top. If you’re booked in at the restaurant, you get the observation deck entry cost deducted from your final bill.

### Visit an repurposed abandoned department store

**Address:** Nedbalova 435/3, 811 01 Bratislava  
[Go to Website](https://www.kcdunaj.sk/)

_KC Dunaj_ is a **cultural and social venue** for Bratislava’s millennials and hipsters housed in a former communist-era department store. A somewhat _dilapidated and graffiti-strewn stairwell_ leads to the 4th floor where you’ll find the bar, an outdoor terrace and a series of rooms that host all kinds of social events throughout the week. Live music, themed parties, film screenings and talks are all on the events programme. On our visit, a language learning event was taking place. Drinks are _local and inexpensive_ and there’s a general friendly vibe that reminded us of Budapest’s ruin pubs.

![Bratislava Castle dominates the city’s skyline](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745833079/bratislava-bratislava-castle-1024x683.jpg_pahyva.webp)

### Visit Bratislava Castle

**Address:** Hrad, 811 06 Bratislava  
[Go to Website](https://www.visitbratislava.com/places/bratislava-castle/)

A dominant landmark of the city, it’s not easy to ignore the white-walled and terracotta-roofed might of Bratislava Castle. Much of the castle that stands today has been restored, though there are still original Gothic and Renaissance elements to be seen. Dedicated at least a few hours to exploring the castle and its grounds as there’s plenty to see.

The Slovak National Museum can be found on the second floor, which maps the history of the country from its inception to the present through a series of engaging displays. To get there, you’ll climb an elegant Baroque staircase that is perfect for some luxurious selfies. Stop for cake and a bottle of Kofola (Czechia’s answer to Coca-Cola) in the cafe and sit by the window for views of the Danube.

![Papichulo is a unique underground pub housed in a former public toilet](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745833080/bratislava-papichulo-1024x683.jpg_tctygn.webp)

### Visit a pub in a former public toilet

**Address:** Americké námestie 1, 811 07 Bratislava

What was once an underground public toilet is now a cosy pub called _Papichulo_. If you’re lucky, you’ll arrive on beer pong night or when there’s a live DJ playing a set. It’s a popular place with locals, so arrive early or on a weeknight to ensure you get a seat. Smoking is unfortunately permitted inside, which ruins the ambiance somewhat. If you can’t stand the smell (and we can’t blame you), head outside to the ground-level terrace.

Staff were very welcoming on our visit, so if you can’t find a seat or you’re not sure what to order, ask. Bring some cash, as cards aren’t accepted.

![Walk along the gangplank a hop aboard Dunajský Pivovar, Bratislava](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1744196271/bratislava-matt-jade-beer-1024x768.jpg_qnn9oa.webp)

### Enjoy a beer on the Danube

**Address:** Tyršovo nábrežie, 851 01 Bratislava-Petržalka  
[Go to Website](http://www.dunajskypivovar.sk/)

Permanently moored to the banks of the Danube, _Dunajský Pivovar_ offers beer from the on-board brewery and _fantastic views_ of Bratislava’s Old Town. Jade and I popped aboard on a whim and found a _warm welcome_, polite service and great beer. If it’s a warm day, sit out on the narrow terrace facing the Old Town so that you can soak it all in and hear the waters of the Danube flowing past.

![Over 500 works of Slovak art can be viewed at Galéria NEDBALKA](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745833080/bratislava-nedbalka-gallery-1024x683.jpg_dcwbrd.webp)

### Take in some Slovak art

**Address:** Nedbalova 485/17, 811 01 Bratislava  
[Go to Website](https://www.nedbalka.sk/en/)

The Nedbalka Gallery is home to over 500 works of permanent and temporary art by Slovak artists from the late 19th century to the present. The gallery space is laid out beautifully across several circular floors, each with a central balcony where you can see all the floors all at once.

Entry is a maximum of €5 with various discounts available.

![Devín Castle has been inhabited since the Neolithic Age](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745833079/bratislava-devin-castle-1024x683.jpg_erwfja.webp)

### Go on a day trip to Devín Castle

**Address:** Muránská 1050/10, 841 10 Devín  
[Go to](http://www.muzeum.bratislava.sk/en/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=700016&id=1025) [Website](https://www.visitbratislava.com/places/devin-castle/)

Once you have explored Bratislava’s city centre, make sure you set aside a day to head out on a day trip to Devín Castle.

Perched on top of (and somewhat within) a 212 metre (605ft) high cliff at the confluence of the rivers Danube and Morava, the ruins of the castle are fun to explore. Actors in full costume bring the history of the ruins to life with spur of the moment demonstrations. Visitors are free to wander the turrets, staircases and gardens and are welcome to view artefacts on display in various exhibitions dotted around the site.

Before or after your visit to the castle, make sure you wander into the adjacent town of Devín for an insight into what life is like for ordinary Slovakians. Opposite the church, you’ll find a great pizza restaurant called _Reštaurácia Valentian_ where prices are considerably lower than the restaurants nearer the castle itself.

****Getting there:**** Devín Castle is 12km away from Bratislava city centre. Bus 29 from Most SNP bus station (underneath the UFO bridge) stops at the castle with a 20 minute journey time. Alternatively, you can get there by taxi or [by boat](https://www.lod.sk/en/cruises-2/).
