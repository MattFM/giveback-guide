Hitchin, Hertfordshire is a small, market town of just over 30,000 residents, with records of its existence dating back around *1000 years*. The *historic* town centre boasts pretty **cobbled streets** lined with a mixture of buildings from the *Tudor and Georgian* periods, housing a surprisingly high number of independent cafes, restaurants and shops.

A small river, the River Hiz, flows lazily alongside *St Marys Church*, the *largest* parish church in Hertfordshire, creating a *pretty and tranquil* setting. In fact, much of Hitchin’s town centre is **calm & peaceful** and therefore a lovely place to window shop, people-watch and relax over an *artisan* coffee.

Many tourists visit the area for nearby *Hitchin Lavender* and often skip the town itself. This though is a mistake, for Hitchin has plenty to offer visitors who are looking to *complement their day out* in the lavender fields with a bit of shopping and perhaps a bite to eat.

The rows of lavender at Hitchin Lavender equal around 40km.


### Hitchin Lavender

**Address:** *Arlesey Rd, Ickleford SG5 3UA*

[View Website](https://www.hitchinlavender.com/)

People come from *all over the world* to visit Hitchin Lavender, and rightly so. In peak flowering season (Jun-Aug), a **carpet of purple flowers bloom** in *breathtaking* style over picturesque rolling fields. Admission includes use of a pair of scissors so that you can cut and keep as much Lavender as you can carry in your bag. The on-site cafe serves tea, cake and *good-quality* lunches in a lovely rustic barn or outside in the garden.

*Plenty of free on-site parking. If you’re car-less, get a taxi.*

Hitchin Lido, part of the Swimming Centre, *opened in 1938* and retains all of the character and style of that era. The *50 metre-long* pool is heated and is **simply gorgeous** on a sunny day. Many visit just to lie in the sunshine and enjoy an ice cream whilst watching more athletic visitors swim lengths. Entry is a little on the steep side, but if you spend an hour or two here, *it’s worth it*. If it’s chilly, there’s also a 25m indoor pool open year round.

*Outdoor pool open May-Sept.*

This 14th-15th century church sits in the heart of Hitchin town centre and is **Hertfordshire’s largest parish church**. The church is notable for how *spacious* it is inside and, thanks to the window’s being unstained, how bright it is. It’s *particularly lovely* on a sunny day! When you visit, look up to admire the *beautiful* wooden ceiling and carvings.

At selected times of year, it’s possible to scale the clock tower for great views of the town. Check out the website for more information on this.

North Hertfordshire Museum’s very existence has been tumultuous. Thankfully, after years of delays and land disputes, the museum is now fully open. On the ground floor, a small gallery of historic artefacts tells the history of the district, whilst an adjacent gallery houses visiting collections on a variety of themes and topics. On the first floor, two more galleries bring the county’s local history to life. There’s now also a cafe serving drinks and light lunches.

*Admission is free.*

## Plan & Book your visit to Hitchin

In this section, we’ll go through how you can plan and book your visit to Hitchin.


### Trains to Hitchin

*Hitchin station* is served by trains operated by **Great Northern** and **Thameslink** between *London and Peterborough/Cambridge*. Trains to Hitchin depart from both *St Pancras International* and *London Kings Cross*.

For spur of the moment visits from London, we recommend visiting Kings Cross primarily, as departures from both Kings Cross and St Pancras International are displayed on the departure boards. Tickets can be purchased right before you travel from ticket offices or self-service machines.

Once you’ve arrived in Hitchin, the town centre is a *15 minute walk* from the station. Metered taxis are normally waiting outside the station if you’d rather get a lift.


### Buses to Hitchin

Hitchin is served by a variety of buses and long distance coaches. National Express runs **coach 777** from *Stansted Airport to Birmingham* and **coach 787** from *Heathrow Airport (T5) to Cambridge* calling at Hitchin town centre.

More locally, Stagecoach run **bus 9a & 9b** to/from *Bedford* and Arriva runs **Sapphire 100 & 101** buses between *Stevenage and Luton/Luton Airport*.


### Getting to Hitchin by road

Hitchin lies a few miles west of junction 8 of the A1(M).

There are plenty of pay & display car parks in Hitchin with cheaper rates after 3pm and free parking on Sundays. You should check for free parking along Hollow Lane (one side of the road is restricted to a maximum of two hours, the other side is unrestricted), though it’s a popular option for locals. Otherwise, we recommend Woodside Car Park (card or mobile payments only) on *Walsworth Road* as it’s pretty good value and not far from the centre.


### Getting around Hitchin

Hitchin is a small town and can be easily traversed on foot.

Wheelchair users and those with limited mobility may have a little difficulty on the cobbled streets of the historic centre and in traversing the steps alongside the river near St Mary’s Square car park. There is a ramp from the market area to the car park behind the public toilets but it’s not signposted.

For attractions outside the town centre (like Hitchin Lavender), we recommend calling local cab company, [Tiny’s](http://www.tinystaxis.co.uk/) on 01462 888 888. Uber also operate a limited service in the area.
