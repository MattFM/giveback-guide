Before we dive in, don’t forget that our entire website is dedicated to uncovering less explored destinations. We’ve provided links to further resources we’ve published throughout this article, so make sure you click through to find out more.

## Visit these amazing less explored places on your next trip

Without further ado, let’s get into it and unearth our first less explored place.

### Bratislava, Slovakia

An easy hop across the border by train from Vienna, Austria, the Slovakian capital has much to offer tourists. If you’re a fan of pretty pedestrianised old towns, museums and galleries, decent nightlife and a contemporary cafe scene, you’ll love Bratislava.

#### Top attractions in Bratislava

- **Bratislava Castle** sits atop a hill that dominates the city’s skyline.
- The **UFO bridge** offers great views of the city accompanied by food and cocktails.

### Moulay Idriss, Morocco

For a true taste of life in Morocco without the tourist traps and hassle of Morocco’s big cities, head to this small town, just to the north of Meknes. As well as a non-touristy medina (which we recommend exploring with a local as your guide), the unmissable UNESCO World Heritage Site of Volubilis is also just down the road.

#### Top attractions in Moulay Idriss

- **Simply wandering the streets** of this town is a treat in itself and offers a taste of life in Morocco without the tourism.

### Kyrenia/Girne, North Cyprus

North Cyprus doesn’t get as many tourists as the southern half of the island, yet there is so much to be seen. The town of Kyrenia/Girne is lovely in itself, but it’s also a great base for exploring the rest of the territory. You can catch a multitude of buses or you can hire a car very inexpensively.

#### Top attractions in Kyrenia/Girne

- The city’s primary attraction is **Kyrenia Castle**, a pristine 16th century Venetian castle.
- Just beyond the city’s limits, you’ll discover **Bellapais Monastery**, the ruins of a 13th Century monastery.

### Zadar, Croatia

While nearby Split and Dubrovnik enjoy all the attention, those in Zadar to the north continue to enjoy a chilled out atmosphere. There’s plenty of historic buildings inside the walls of the pristine old town and the surrounding landscape and seas are gorgeous.

#### Top attractions in Zadar

- The narrow lanes of the fortified **Old Town** are all gorgeous, with off-white stone and marble used in abundance.
- The **Church of St Donatus** is a distinctive round building, constructed in the 9th century.

### Aarhus, Denmark

Denmark’s second city is a great less explored destination, particularly if you’re seeking somewhere to spend a long weekend. There are great food options, a youthful, modern vibe and world-class museums and art galleries.

### Brno, Czechia

Czechia’s second city is painfully pretty, wonderfully progressive and perfectly set up for tourists. Despite the warm welcome and abundance of tourist attractions, it still remains in Prague’s shadow and is relatively unknown.

#### Top attractions in Brno

- Get a birds-eye view of the entire city centre from the **Old Town Hall Observation Tower**.
- **Brno is a city of art**, offering a plethora of galleries and street art. One of the artistic highlights (or lowlights depending on your perspective) is the quirky Astronomical Clock.

### Schliersee, Germany

For a true taste of Bavarian culture, Schliersee is a great less explored choice. A short train ride from Munich, this small spa town has plenty of scenic outdoor pursuits for you to enjoy. We can recommend hiring an electric boat on the lake or hiring an electric bicycle and exploring the nearby villages amidst the mountains.

#### Top attractions in Schliersee

- The lake itself, after which the town is named, is a glittering spectacle which you can circumnavigate on foot or bicycle or sail on.

### Argegno, Italy

It’s hard to find a prettier and more authentically Italian lakeside village than Argegno in our opinion. Regardless, this village on the shores of Lake Como sees hardly any tourists compared with other villages close-by. The cable car up to the village of Pigra is splendid.

#### Top attractions in Argegno

- **Argegno is a great base for exploring** the rest of Lake Como, without having to deal with the daily crowds.
- A **cable car** takes visitors 540 metres up the side of the mountain to the peaceful village of Pigra.
- If you don’t fancy swimming in the lake itself, Argegno is home to its own **lido**.

### Valetta, Malta

Whilst knowledge of the Maltese capital is growing, it’s still relatively unheard of. We loved the unique architecture throughout the city centre and the warm welcome we received from locals.

#### Top attractions in Valetta

- The fortress city of Valetta is **full of historical landmarks and unique architecture** – simply wander the city centre aimlessly and see what you discover.
- **Upper Barrakka Gardens** is a great place to mix with locals and for splendid views of the harbour.

### Poznań, Poland

Poznań is a city in Poland that’s packed with great things to see and do. The city is steeped in history, yet enjoys a youthful and laid back vibe with flourishes of modern architecture and public artwork. For tourists, the city offers a great deal and manages to do so without ripping anyone off, yet Poznań is still relatively unheard of in the travel world.

### Ljubljana, Slovenia

The Slovenian capital city of Ljubljana is a delight. Much of the centre is pedestrianised, clean and peaceful with beautiful architecture lining streets that lead to attractive squares filled with locals enjoying life.

As you explore, you’ll love the friendly, calm atmosphere and the warm smiles you’ll be met with. Hiring a bike is very easy and the provision of safe bicycle lanes means that getting around is a breeze.

#### Top attractions in Ljubljana

- Depicted on the city’s coat of arms and visible all over the city, **Ljubljana Castle** is the city’s most recognisable icon and easily its most touristy attraction.
