In this post, we explore the exciting and ever growing world of eco-friendly travel products.

When we travel, our attention is split much more than usual and that means we spend less time thinking about our individual impact on the planet. With the climate in crisis, it is the responsibility of each of us to ensure our negative impact on the environment is minimised. That means we should be making sustainable choices about the things we take with us on our adventures.

## Not just for travel, for everyday life too

In this list of eco-friendly travel products, we’ve included things for your wellbeing, for your convenience and your style. Switching to more sustainable alternatives does take time, so we’d strongly encourage you to take your time and make switches some time before you intend to set off.

After all, sustainability should be a part of our everyday lives, not just when we’re on our travels.

## Why switch to eco-friendly alternatives?

Many of the consumer products we buy every day have not been made with sustainability and eco-friendliness in mind. Many contain unnecessary plastic, much of which is virgin plastic, and many are non-recyclable. We cannot go on living like this. The planet is suffering as a result of human action.

We have to encourage mass change and one of the ways we can do that is by making conscious choices about the products that we buy.

## Everything under one roof

We would encourage you to buy products directly from makers so that they can get the maximum benefit, but we appreciate that that isn’t always practical. For those occasions when you know you want to buy lots of eco-friendly travel products all at once, there are online stores that have everything (or at least most things) under one roof.

- For those based in the UK, [AndKeep is an excellent choice](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=21291&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fandkeep.com). They have a massive range (including their own branded stuff) and delivery is free for orders over £40 or a flat-rate of £2.49 for lower priced orders.

- For those in the US, [EarthHero is by far the best option](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=23846&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fearthhero.com) we’ve come across so far. Their range is gigantic!

## Our list of the ultimate eco-friendly travel products for your sustainable travels

Let’s not waste any more time and get right into our list of eco-friendly travel products. We’ve selected these products based on our own experiences and recent swaps we’ve made ourselves both at home and on our travels.

Just a quick note, before you get stuck in – this post is very much still a work in progress. We intend to keep adding retailers and ideas to this post. To be notified of future changes, do make sure you subscribe.

![What better way to carry your eco-friendly travel products than in an eco-friendly bag (Wave)](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745239718/wave-bag-1024x683.jpg_jtdjf4.webp)

### Sustainable luggage and backpacks

Choosing a bag to put all your stuff in isn’t a decision you should take lightly. To begin with, anticipating that types of places you’re likely to want to visit is important. Is the terrain going to be a hindrance to a wheelie suitcase, for example?

Add in a need for your luggage to be ethically-made using sustainable materials and the process is complicated even further. We think though it’s worth your effort and time though and definitely worth spending some decent cash on – generally speaking, you do get your money’s worth when it comes to luggage.

Below, we’ve picked out a few eco-friendly luggage options that’ve caught our eye.

- **LaBante London:** Vegan, sustainable and ethical fashion backpacks, totes, handbags and purses. Materials are vegan, non-PVC and ethically-sourced. [UK-based with global shipping available](https://go.skimresources.com?id=85974X1563631&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Flabante.co.uk).

- **Wave:** Starting out making phone cases, Wave are now broadening their range [with this rolltop backpack made from up to 40 recycled plastic bottles](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=24785&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wavecase.co.uk%2Fshop%2Fp%2Fwave-roll-top-backpack). It’s waterproof, has adjustable straps, includes a padded laptop sleeve and is great value. Free, carbon-neutral delivery to the UK and just £5 to the rest of the world. _Get an extra 5% off with code GWN33PI_

- **We Are Menos:** The [perfect everyday carry-on backpack](https://wearemenos.com/heretotravel), made from recycled plastic. The Menos backpack combines a stunning, minimalist aesthetic with uncompromising functionality.

![BambuuBrush: an eco-friendly toothbrush that’s made from biodegradable bamboo (BambuuBrush)](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745239755/bambuu-brush-1024x683.jpg_ys5vzo.webp)

### Eco-friendly Manual Toothbrush

Millions upon millions of plastic toothbrushes are thrown away around the world each year. They all end up in landfill and take hundreds of years to decompose. The absurdity of this wastefulness is heightened even further when you consider that there’s a very easy and cheap way to fix this problem.

Bamboo toothbrushes are now really easy to come by and really affordable. Below, we’ve picked out a few examples.

- **BambuuBrush:** Inspired by seeing for themselves the negative impact of plastic pollution around the world, Tommie and Rebecca [set up BambuuBrush to tackle the problem, one bamboo toothbrush at a time](https://bambuubrush.com/collections/bambuubrush-range/products/bambuubrush). 10% of every sale goes to the Humanitas charity. Worldwide delivery.

- **Truthbrush:** Designed by an all female team dedicated to sustainability, [their award winning bamboo toothbrush](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=19976&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fthetruthbrush.com%2Fcollections%2Fshop%2Fproducts%2Fnew-truthtabs-wild-mint-flavour-toothpaste-tablets) comes in a range of colours and in zero-waste packaging. UK delivery.

![Suri is a carbon neutral electric toothbrush that ticks all the boxes](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745239886/suri-toothbrush-1024x683.jpg_lrrbr5.webp)

### Sustainable Electric Toothbrush

We were approached by **Suri** to try out their [sustainable electric toothbrush](http://www.trysuri.com/) and we jumped at the chance. Having now used it, we can safely recommend this to everyone.

Delivering 33,000 sonic vibrations a minute, this brush provides a great clean. But on top of this, the brush itself it made from fully biodegradable and recyclable materials. You can even post your used heads back to Suri in the provided compostable mailer. The product is certified carbon neutral and the company is a pending B Corp.

![Avoid non-recyclable toothpaste tubes with ease with a range of products (Georganics)](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745239829/georganics-tooth-tablets-1-1024x683.jpg_hhdfw0.webp)

### Toothpaste, powder and tablets

Traditional toothpaste tubes are practically non-recyclable. Even if a toothpaste tube ends up in a recycling plant (and most don’t), the process of separating out the plastics is a costly and timely task.

Ditching traditional toothpaste for eco-friendly alternatives is now very straightforward. Toothpaste as you know it is available in glass jars and alternatives like powder and tablets are also available. We ourselves now use tablets that comes in biodegradable bags. They work brilliantly!

Below, we’ve found a few eco-friendly toothpaste alternatives.

- **NOICE:** [Highly-rated charcoal toothpaste delivered in a recyclable glass bottle](https://noicecareuk.sjv.io/7mKOQ3). Provided you recycle the bottle and keep using the plastic pump, there’s zero waste. Delivery to the UK & France and the USA & Canada\*.

- **Georganics:** Offers a [wide range of tablets and powders to replace traditional tubes of toothpaste](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=23054&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.georganics.com), all delivered in recyclable glass jars. Also offers mouthwash tablets and natural chewing gum. Worldwide delivery.

- **Truthtabs:** [One box of Truthtabs should last you a month](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=19976&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fthetruthbrush.com%2Fcollections%2Fshop%2Fproducts%2Fnew-truthtabs-wild-mint-flavour-toothpaste-tablets), making them great value. They contain fluoride, come in a wild mint flavour and are delivered to the UK in fully biodegradable packing.

![Dental floss doesn’t have to be made of plastic and come in plastic packaging (Georganics)](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745239819/dental-floss-1024x683.jpg_oc0xls.webp)

### Plastic-free dental floss and interdentals

Dental floss and interdentals are often made from plastic and are completely non-recyclable. Couple the fact that they’re generally single-use products and you have a horribly environmentally-unfriendly product.

Thankfully, there are alternatives available. It’s now possible to buy floss made from plants and reusable interdentals, some of which are made from bamboo. Below are a few examples.

- **Georganics:** [Floss made from cruelty-free and compostable corn-based material](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=23054&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.georganics.com) and delivered worldwide in fully zero-waste packaging.

- **&Keep Interdentals:** You can find interdentals with bamboo handles in most sustainability shops. [We use these from &Keep](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=21291&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fandkeep.com%2Fproducts%2Fkeep-bamboo-interdental-brushes-various-sizes), which comes in a range of ISO standard sizes. International delivery available.

![The plastic-free bath and shower bar scene is booming. Replace those plastic bottles now](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745239872/soap-bars-1024x683.jpg_hrmmkk.webp)

### Shower & bath soap

When thinking about eco-friendly travel products, taking bars of body soap with you is a no brainer.

Not only do you instantly dispense with the single-use plastic bottles, but you also have a product that bypasses liquid allowances in hand luggage when flying. You also lose any risk of messy liquid soap explosions inside your luggage. We all know what that’s like.

We transitioned to using bars of body soap some time ago. It does take a bit of time to adjust to using them, but once you do, you never go back. You can find body soap anywhere, but try to make sure you stick to products that are vegan, cruelty-free, plastic-free, palm oil free and organic if you can.

- **Natural soaps by Jungle Culture:** These [handmade soaps are rich in organic essential oils and vegan friendly, cruelty-free, palm oil free and plastic-free](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=26152&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fjungleculture.eco%2Fcollections%2Fnatural-soaps). They even sell a reusable tin to put them in. Worldwide delivery from the UK.

- **Friendly Soaps:** It’s very common to find a range of Friendly Soaps at sustainability and vegan markets and in zero-waste shops. We’ve tried out a few and they’re a reliable brand of vegan, cruelty-free soaps that come in plastic-free packaging. [You can find a large range of Friendly soaps on &Keep, along with other brands](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=21291&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fandkeep.com%2Fcollections%2Fsoaps-bath-salts).

![Most well-known shampoo brands come in plastic bottles and are not cruelty-free. Time to ditch them](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745239867/shampoo-hair-washing-1024x683.jpg_chqbgh.webp)

### Shampoo and conditioner bars

Similarly to body soap (above), ditching single-use plastic bottles and buying bars of shampoo and conditioner is a total no brainer for any eco-friendly traveller. Not only are they better for the environment, they don’t take up much room in your bag either.

- **&Keep:** [Here, you’ll find a range of different brands to try out](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=21291&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fandkeep.com%2Fcollections%2Fshampoo-conditioner-bars). Finding a shampoo bar that works with your hair can take some trial and error, so be prepared to try different brands before you go away.

- **EarthHero:** If you’re in the US, [EarthHero have a huge range of hair care products](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=23846&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fearthhero.com%2Fproduct-category%2Fbeauty-care%2Fhair-care%2F) for you to browse. Be mindful though of avoiding the plastic bottles.

![Keep your pits fresh and dry with sustainable deodorant](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745239905/woman-pits-1024x683.jpg_z6psjk.webp)

### Sustainable deodorant

Traditional spray deodorants often come in containers that utilise both plastic and metal. Most are recyclable, but some aren’t. This aside, it’s always better to reduce your use of such materials in the first instance, so sustainable deodorants are always a better choice for the environment. Most of the eco-friendly options come in either reusable containers or come wrapped in paper or cardboard.

Switching to solid deodorant can take some time as you find one that works for you. With this in mind, do make sure you’ve tried out your chosen deodorant before taking it away with you.

- **Wild Natural Deodorant:** [Aluminium free, cruelty-free & vegan deodorant](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=19550&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wearewild.com) with compostable, plastic free refills with 300,000 sold since their April 2020 launch. Delivery to most countries world-wide.

- **Fussy:** An alternative to Wild is Fussy, who make [their own refillable deodorant that’s free from aluminium, parabens and 100% vegan](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=24709&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.getfussy.com). You might have seen this brand on _Dragon’s Den_ (the UK’s _Shark Tank_).

- **AKT**: If you want to avoid being tied into a refill system, [AKT are a good option](https://www.aktlondon.com). Their vegan and cruelty-free deodorant comes in its own plastic-free and recyclable tube.

- Two brands of sustainable deodorant you see a lot of in the UK are **Salt of the Earth** and **Earth Conscious**. You can [view ranges from both of these brands, along with others, on &Keep](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=21291&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fandkeep.com%2Fcollections%2Fdeodorant-perfumes).

![Zero-waste safety razors are now easy to come by, but some are funkier than others (Jungle Culture)](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745239862/safety-razor-1024x683.jpg_guv2wm.webp)

### Plastic-free razor

There are lots of mail-order shaving products available these days and many of them make bold sustainability claims. Truth is though, many of these companies are still utilising plastic housing for their blades. Some offer a recycling scheme, but you normally have to save up around 10-12 blades before then have to post them back at your expense. Not very straightfoward.

The best option is the buy a razor that takes standard-sized recyclable razor blades. You can buy plastic-free handles that are either entirely metal or contain a mixture of bamboo and metallic parts. We’ve featured a couple of options below.

- **Jungle Culture:** Part of a range of sustainable products, this [unisex safety razor is entirely made of metal and takes standard, recyclable, double-edged steel blades](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=26152&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fjungleculture.eco%2Fcollections%2Fsafety-razors%2Fproducts%2Fsafety-razor-for-women-men%3Fawc%3D26152_1644588482_188515ebcafd1c97325f2d6bf9e3faa0) (sold separately). There’s a range of lovely colours and it even comes with a jute travel bag. Worldwide delivery from the UK.

- **BamBaw:** [This metal razor handle comes with a blade to get you started](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=21291&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fandkeep.com%2Fcollections%2Fplastic-free-razor-shaving%2Fproducts%2Fbambaw-stainless-steel-double-edge-metal-safety-razor-with-stand%3Fvariant%3D31299379232839) and comes in a range of bright colours. We particular like the look of the rose gold variant.

![All natural cotton buds are slowly becoming the norm worldwide (BambuuBrush)](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745239814/cotton-buds-1024x683.jpg_hhzna7.webp)

### Plastic-free cotton buds

In 2020, single-use plastic cotton buds were rightfully banned in England. Instead, consumers would have to opt for buds made from cardboard, but generally, these still end up in landfill. While you can buy cotton buds the are made from bamboo and are therefore biodegradable, we think the better option is to buy reusable swabs.

- **&Keep:** You can bamboo cotton buds almost anywhere, but if you’re stocking up and you’re already buying stuff from &Keep, [why not throw some into your basket](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=21291&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fandkeep.com%2Fcollections%2Fcotton-buds).

- **BambuuBrush:** Purveyors of bamboo toothbrushes also sell [boxes of organic cotton and bamboo buds](https://bambuubrush.com/collections/bambuubrush-range/products/the-bamboo-cotton-buds).

![It’s tricky making sexual wellness products eco-friendly, but some companies are trying (Here We Flo)](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745239810/condoms-1024x683.jpg_a5r1f6.webp)

### More eco-friendly sexual wellness products

It’s always a good idea to be prepared for a bit of romance and, thankfully, you can now do so without having too much of an impact on the planet.

To be fair, there’s still some work to do to make sexual wellness products more eco-friendly, but there are at least some companies who are trying their best. We’ve listed a couple of them below.

- **Hanx:** There’s [a range of sexual health products on offer here](https://www.hanxofficial.com), but their core offering is vegan condoms made of 100% fair rubber latex and vegan, natural lube. UK Delivery.

- **Here We Flo:** Carbon-neutral, vegan, cruelty-free and made from sustainably-sourced rubber latex, [these condoms also give back with 5% of profits going to sustainability projects](https://www.hereweflo.co). Excellent!

![Most sunscreens come in plastic bottles and many aren’t reef-safe. Other though buck the trend (Kri Skincare)](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745239848/kri-sunscreen-1024x683.jpg_fdvsg1.webp)

### Reef-friendly sunscreen

Coral reefs are facing all kinds of problems, so the last thing they needed was for sunscreen to harm them too. Alas, it’s been recently discovered that sunscreen and other skin products used by humans contain toxins that permanently alters the DNA of coral. Shocking!

Thankfully, there are reef-friendly options out there. These options tend to be all natural and therefore kinder to your skin, and they also tend to come packaged in sustainable packing.

- **Kri Skincare:** We love companies that go above and beyond to do the right thing, and Sri is no exception. Their [SPF 30 mineral sunscreen is cruelty-free and vegan](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=26292&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fkriskincare.com%2Fcollections%2Fsunscreen) and designed to be used daily. It comes in a fully recyclable glass jar with aluminium lid.

- **Shade All Natural Organic Sunscreen:** [This sunscreen contains just four natural ingredients](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=21291&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fandkeep.com%2Fcollections%2Fsunscreen%2Fproducts%2Fshade-all-natural-organic-sunscreen-spf25-100ml), yet it protects your skin from a broad spectrum of damaging UVA and UVB rays. Comes in a reusable or recyclable tin. Contains beeswax. UK delivery only.
- 
![Ditch the chemical-infused spray in a plastic bottle and choose something much more natural](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745239843/insect-repellent-hands-1024x683.jpg_ntv4sp.webp)

### Natural insect repellent

Similarly to many of the other eco-friendly travel products in this list, Insect Repellent is another one where avoiding single use plastic is the name of the game. Many spray-on repellents come in plastic bottles, or they come in metal canisters with plastic buttons and caps.

Avoid all this with creams/gels that come inside plastic-free, fully recyclable tins or insect repellent bars.

- **Khakibos Repel Gel:** No need for chemicals – [Khakibos has been used across the African continent as an effective insect repellent for hundreds of years](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=21291&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fandkeep.com%2Fcollections%2Finsect-repellent%2Fproducts%2Frepel-gel-natural-insect-repellent-by-flawless-skincare). Citronella, Geranium and Lemon Eucalyptus combine with very effective results. It’s vegan-friendly and palm oil free. UK delivery.

![Your feminine hygiene products needn’t come wrapped in plastic. (Here We Flo)](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745239838/here-we-flo-1024x683.jpg_iegm4f.webp)

### Plastic-free period care & menstrual products

Traditional sanitary products are a plastic-fille nightmare. Not only do they contain plastic, but they’re normally wrapped in plastic too.

We get it, these types of products have to be hygienic, but that doesn’t necessarily mean plastic has to be involved. There are alternatives, as we will now demonstrate.

- **Here We Flo:** [Tampons and pads made from sustainable, organic bamboo & cotton](https://www.hereweflo.co/pages/period-care-subscription-boxes) which come inside plant-based and compostable wrappers. There’s also zero irritating, synthetic fibres, pesticide residues, bleach, dyes or fragrances. 5% of profits go to charities fighting period poverty and FGM. UK delivery.

- **TOTM:** A range of products, including [organic cotton tampons, pads, liners & zero-waste menstrual cups](https://heretotravel.com/go/totm/), with a very strong focus on ethics and sustainability. UK delivery only.

- **Flux Undies:** Many travellers will find that the best option for them is period underwear. Flux makes [super absorbent, eco-friendly period pants](https://www.fluxundies.com) that keep you dry and comfortable all day. Delivery to the UK and worldwide.

![Vitamins and supplements in plastic bottles are now easily avoidable (DR.VEGAN)](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745239824/dr-vegan-1024x683.jpeg_m4fk04.webp)

### Better vitamins and supplements

Vitamins are often not vegetarian and normally come inside plastic bottles and tubs. Thankfully, there are alternatives that are both vegan and packaged more sustainably.

- **DR.VEGAN:** Plant-based supplements that tick all the boxes. Gluten-free, allergen-free and non-GMO, [there’s a range of easy to swallow tablets available](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=21553&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fdrvegan.com)\*, all of which comes inside plastic-free and fully compostable bags. Brilliant! Free UK delivery and worldwide delivery also available.

![Reusable make-up remover pads/cloths are a great sustainable option](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745239853/make-up-remover-1024x683.jpg_xoqcqf.webp)

### Reusable make-up cloths

Surprisingly, many pre-packaged moist make-up remover cloths contain plastic (and of course, come wrapped in plastic too). Madness!

Something that works as equally well and also saves you some weight in your luggage is a reusable cloth and a bit of water. You can pick these up at supermarkets and shops that sell cosmetics and beauty products.

![Protect your mobile phone with a case made from fully biodegradable wheat straw (Wave)](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745239901/wave-case-1024x683.jpg_tncope.webp)

### Biodegradable mobile phone case

These days, having a mobile phone on you as you travel is absolutely essential. It’s a device to plan and book elements of your trip, pay for stuff and something you can use to capture memories. Protecting your phone is therefore really important.

While there are many cases on the market that are made from plastic, you can now also buy phone cases that are made from biodegradable material (wheat straw is a common one). We use Wave cases (see below) and totally recommend them, but there are other options for you to consider too.

- **Wave:** _We use these ourselves on our phones!_ Made from fully biodegradable wheat straw, [these phone cases are grippy and durable and come in a range of great colours and designs](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=24785&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wavecase.co.uk%2Fshop)\*.

### Canvas shopping/tote bags

We now don’t go anywhere without a set of canvas tote bags rolled up in our suitcase. They’re so useful for shopping and often, they double as dirty laundry bags. The fact they’re reusable and help us to avoid single-use plastic bags is an easy environmental win.

You can pick up tote bags really easily, but we recommend investing in really good quality bags from your favourite charities for added goodness.

- **Sumatran Orangutan Society bags:** [These organic cotton bags](https://orangutansstore.com/collection/tote-bags/) have great designs and a traceable ethical supply chain.

- **We Are All Human Here by Humanitas:** [This organic cotton tote designed by the Humanitas charity](https://weareallhumanhere.teemill.com/product/tote-bag-light/) makes a fabulous statement.

### Eco-friendly packing cubes

Packing cubes are a bit of a god-send for seasoned travellers. They effortlessly help to keep all your belongings organised and also help to make the best use of the space you have. It’s a win all round!

What isn’t a win however is the material that packing cubes are often made from. It’s typically virgin plastic. Yuck! Swerve these and invest in packing cubes that are instead made from fully recycled materials.

- Both [Patagonia](https://eu.patagonia.com/gb/en/shop/black-hole-packing-cubes-tote-bags) and [Kathmandu](https://www.kathmandu.co.uk/gear/accessories/pack-accessories.html?page=1) having packing cubes that are made from recycled plastic bottles. Both companies also go to great lengths for sustainability, with Kathmandu in particular being a certified B Corp.

![For long trips, you’ll need laundry detergent. Thankfully, there are eco-friendly and lightweight options](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745239891/washing-machines-1024x683.jpg_ijwwhx.webp)

### Eco-friendly laundry detergent

Depending on the length of your trip, you’ll probably need laundry detergent. Occasionally, you’ll find washing machines with detergent built-in (very handy), but you can’t always rely on this. That’s why it’s handy to have some with you and thankfully, there are options that are lightweight, eco-friendly and plastic-free.

- **Tru Earth:** The best option for laundry detergent on the go is a laundry sheet. There are plenty of brands that make these, but a common brand is Tru Earth. [You can buy packs of Tru Earth’s hypoallergenic, vegan and paraben-free laundry sheets at &Keep](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=21291&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fandkeep.com%2Fcollections%2Flaundry-detergent%2Fproducts%2Ftru-earth-eco-strips-laundry-detergent-fresh-linen).

![Sunglasses made from recycled plastic are more eco-friendly than those made from virgin plastic](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745239881/sunglasses-1024x683.jpg_w3vwaj.webp)

### More sustainable sunglasses

Sunglasses are an essential part of your travel kit, but often overlooked when taking eco-friendliness into consideration. Sunnies are something many of us keep for a long time and are therefore worth investing a good chunk of change on to get a high-quality, long-lasting product.

You can couple your investment with your sustainability demands by purchasing one of the following eco-friendly alternatives.

- **Coral Eyewear:** Makes sustainable sunglasses and spectacles made from rescued fishing nets and recycled plastic, designed in the UK and handcrafted in Italy. [Carbon-neutral and plastic-free delivery worldwide](https://go.skimresources.com?id=85974X1563631&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coraleyewear.com).

### Eco-friendly fashion

The fashion industry is dogged by controversy, malpractice, exploitation and environmental neglect. Most consumers love a bargain and regretfully, this has led to a litany of issues resulting from cost-cutting.

Your choices really do make a difference and can drive positive change, so shop wisely. Below are a couple of suggestions for truly sustainable, green-washing-free fashion stores.

- **Kind Clothing:** We love [Kind Clothing’s range of awesome styles and designs](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20421&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fkind-clothing.com). All their products are vegan and cruelty-free, come in plastic-free packaging and every purchase plants a tree too.

- **Vegan Outfitters:** Let’s be honest, vegans love telling people that we’re vegan. Go the extra mile and [wear your lifestyle choice with pride](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20371&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fveganoutfitters.com) with Vegan Outfitter’s excellent range. [We particularly like the Doodle T-Shirt](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20371&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fveganoutfitters.com%2Fcollections%2Ftrending%2Fproducts%2Fdoodle-t-shirt-unisex).

![A lightweight, plastic-free and reusable cutlery set is an essential eco-friendly travel product for your travels](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745239800/bamboo-cutlery-1024x683.jpg_us10fo.webp)

### Reusable cutlery/chopsticks

Every traveller needs cutlery and chopsticks, regardless of their destination. Reject the free single-use plastic cutlery offered to you by food vendors and bring you own. Here are a few suggestions that we’ve found.

- **Bamboo cutlery by Jungle Culture:** These [gorgeous bamboo cutlery sets are completely chemical-free, plastic-free and organic](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=26152&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fjungleculture.eco%2Fcollections%2Fbamboo-cutlery) and come in an organic cotton pouch. Worldwide delivery from the UK.

- **Cutlery by BambuuBrush:** [Reusable cutlery set consisting of a fork, knife and spoon](https://bambuubrush.com/collections/bambuubrush-range/products/the-bamboo-cutlery) that goes inside a canvas bag. 10% of every purchase goes to the Humanitas charity.

![Every eco-friendly traveller should have a reusable water bottle in their luggage (Wave)](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745239896/wave-bottle-1024x683.jpg_y8eak3.webp)

### Reusable water bottle

We were late to the game when it came to travelling with a water bottle. Now, we wouldn’t leave home without one. A water bottle not only helps to keep you hydrated, helps you to avoid sugary drinks and saves you money in the long-run, but it also helps you to avoid having to buy drinks in plastic bottles. Wins all round!

- **Wave:** [A 600ml metal water bottle that keeps drinks cold for 24 hours and hot for 12 hours](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=24785&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wavecase.co.uk%2Fshop%2Fp%2Fwave-bottle). It’s BPA free, leakproof and delivered in recyclable packaging. Carbon-neutral delivery to the UK is free, while delivery elsewhere is just £5.

![A reusable cup for hot drinks will help you to avoid using non-recyclable coffee cups (SoleCup)](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745239877/solecup-1024x683.jpg_ff9iy8.webp)

### Reusable hot drinks cup

Similarly to the water bottle (see above), having a reusable hot drinks cup in your luggage will help you to avoid using often completely non-recyclable coffee cups from your favourite coffee outlets. It’ll also help you to save a bit of cash long-term as many coffee shops offer a small discount for those who bring their own receptacles.

- **Solecup:** [We have one of these sustainable coffee cups and can vouch for their greatness](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6091&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fuk%2Fshop%2FSoleCup). All the materials are either recyclable or biodegradable and the final products are sturdy and built to last. The cups even come in fully recyclable, plastic-free boxes. Yay! Buy from their Etsy shop for global shipping.

### Reusable straws

The plastic straw is thankfully (slowly) being outlawed around the world. Continue to shun them with confidence by bringing your own.

- **Bamboo and stainless steel straws by Jungle Culture:** There’s [a range of straws on offer here, made from both bamboo and stainless steel](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=26152&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fjungleculture.eco%2Fcollections%2Freusable-straws). The straws come inside cute bags made from jute. They even sell bamboo straws cleaners. Worldwide delivery from the UK.

- **BambuuBrush:** Tommie and Rebecca sell [washable and reusable straws made from both bamboo and stainless steel](https://bambuubrush.com/collections/bambuubrush-range/products/the-reusable-straws?variant=35538120114325).

### Vegan wax food wraps

At home, these work an absolute treat and have helped us to entirely replace our use of cling film (plastic wrap) and tin foil. The food wraps we have are washable, reusable and do a great job at keeping our food fresh and clean. Just be mindful though of wraps made from bee’s wax – there’s no need for us to be pinching wax from bees when there are alternatives available.

Food wraps won’t take up much room or weight in your luggage, so it’s worth chucking some in. You can now pick up food wraps at local eco-stores or [online from stores like &Keep](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=21291&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fandkeep.com%2Fcollections%2Ftype-food-wraps) (UK) or [EarthHero (US)](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=23846&awinaffid=138444&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fearthhero.com%2Fproduct-category%2Fhome%2Fkitchen%2Ffood-storage%3Ffwp_type%3Dfood-wraps%26fwp_material%3Dplant-based-resin).
