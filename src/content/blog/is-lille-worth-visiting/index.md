Is Lille worth visiting? In this post, you’ll discover 12 things to do in Lille, France which will help you to determine whether Lille is a worthwhile place for you to visit.

Lille is conveniently located in the north-eastern tip of France, close to the Belgian border, making it easy to visit for those in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and England. Add the fact that Lille is very well connected by railway (including via high speed lines) and it’s a wonder why it took us so long to visit.

At the end of this guide, we’ll go through how to plan and book your trip to Lille. We’ve also included a couple of things to do in Roubaix, a neighbouring city that has become a part of the greater metropolitan area of Lille.

## Is Lille worth visiting?

Let’s cut to the chase; in our opinion, Lille is definitely worth visiting. We had a great time during our stay.

Lille has plenty of things to see and do and a wide enough variety of things to interest most people. It’s really easy to explore the city on foot and by the well integrated public transport network. We really liked how chilled out the city felt and we liked that there was a good mix of grand buildings and grittier, characterful neighbourhoods.

If you’re interested in knowing how we came to this conclusion, keep reading.

## 12 top things to do in Lille, France

Close to the end of this post, we’ve included some things to do in neighbouring Roubaix (which is a part of the greater Lille metropolitan area). Before that though, let’s discover some of the best things to do in Lille itself that makes Lille worth visiting.

We used a **Lille City Pass** during our visit (which was kindly gifted to us by Lille Tourism). The City Pass gives free access to 29 of Lille’s best attractions, plus free unlimited use of the public transport network.

![La Grand Place is the city’s main square and is always busy](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745577053/lille-grand-place-1024x683.jpeg-1_ruueda.webp)

### Visit La Grand Place (Main Square)

**Address:** Pl. du Général de Gaulle, 59800 Lille, France

A great starting place for your explorations in Lille. Here, you’ll get a really good feel for the place and you’ll be able to enjoy some of Lille’s fabulous architecture. Surrounding the square are cafes and restaurants that are housed within buildings dating back to the 17th century and sport a distinctly Flemish style, a nod towards the city’s status as ‘Capital of Flanders’.

Occasionally, events are held in the square and around Christmas, a huge Ferris Wheel is erected offering fabulous views of the city centre below.

![Book stalls are a permanent feature inside the inner courtyard of La Vieille Bourse. Make sure you have a rummage](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745577063/lille-vieille-bourse-book-stalls-1024x683.jpeg_svxjb1.webp)

### Explore the inner courtyard of La Vieille Bourse (Old Stock Exchange)

**Address:** Pl. du Général de Gaulle, 59000 Lille, France

Often described as Lille’s finest building, La Vieille Bourse is located adjacent to La Grand Place and is a gorgeous example of 17th century Flemish Renaissance architecture. Visitors are welcome to wander into the inner courtyard where secondhand booksellers routinely set up shop, chess players do battle and locals meet their friends before going on to night’s out.

Do make sure you browse the stalls for treasures. There are English language books hidden away, but the French language books should also be of interest. There’s also stamp collections, artworks, posters and magazines available. Dig through the stacks to see what you can find.

![Wazemmes Market has indoor and outdoor market stalls](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745577058/lille-marche-de-wazemmes-food-1024x683.jpeg_begb2v.webp)

### Browse for bargains at Marché de Wazemmes (Wazemmes Market)

**Address:** Pl. Nouvelle Aventure, 59000 Lille, France

For a snapshot of everyday life in Lille, _Marche de Wazemmes_ provides beautifully. There are two parts to the market – a covered market that operates everyday of the week and an expansive outdoor market that runs on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays.

The market is one of the largest in the whole of France and is a great place to find good value food, flowers, clothing and fabrics. We visited in the pouring rain, yet even then, the atmosphere was buzzing.

The surrounding area offers lots of decent food options, particularly world cuisine, though not too many obvious vegan options unfortunately.

![Meet the dogs at Le Waf and perhaps even adopt one](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745577058/lille-le-waf-dog-cafe-1024x683.jpg-1_sojibt.webp)

### Play with adoptees at Europe’s 1st Dog Cafe

**Address:** 57 Rue de la Barre, 59800 Lille, France  
[Visit Website](https://lewaf.fr/)

Self-described as Europe’s 1st Dog Cafe, Le Waf is similar to cat cafes, albeit instead of cats, there’s dogs. A flat fee of €8 gives you access to the cafe and an all-you-can-consume selection of food and drink (we’re not sure whether vegans are catered to)

Typically, we’re cautious about listing establishments that involve animals. In this case however, the operators of Le Waf work with dog rehoming organisations to find permanent homes for the dogs. The cafe says 1-3 of the dogs in the cafe at any one time are available for adoption. At the very least, the dogs get some love and attention and at best, they find a family.

![Porte de Paris certainly has a Parisian air about it](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745577060/lille-porte-de-paris-1024x683.jpg_xwdy53.webp)

### Admire the Porte de Paris

**Address:** Pl. Simon Vollant, 59800 Lille, France

In 1667, Louis XIV captured Lille and to mark the occasion, this stunning triumphal arch was constructed. The arch is currently undergoing some restoration work, but it’s still easy to see how impressive and grand it is.

The arch resides on a quiet roundabout surrounded by residential buildings that have a very strong resemblance to buildings in Paris itself, so for a moment (and from certain angles), you could almost convince yourself you were in Paris.

Adjacent to the arch is _Beffroi de Lille_ (below), considered by many as the architectural icon of Lille.

![The iconic Beffroi de l’Hôtel de Ville is one of the best things to do in Lille](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745577053/lille-beffroi-1024x683.jpg_jiyxmj.webp)

### Ascend the Beffroi de l’Hôtel de Ville (Town Hall Belfry)

**Address:** Pl. Simon Vollant, 59000 Lille, France  
[Visit Website](https://en.lilletourism.com/visit-of-the-belfry-of-the-town-hall-1.html)

The 104 metre high Beffroi de Lille is not just a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it’s a building that’s often used to represent the entire city. The Classic Art-Deco style somewhat disguises its relative youth – after the original was destroyed in World War I, the tower we see today was opened as recently as 1932. From the top, the views are stunning, though the height is certainly not for the faint hearted.

[Booking a guided visit is essential](https://heretotravel.com/go/getyourguide-lille-belfry/) and must be done at least 24 hours in advance. Regretfully, the tower is not suitable for those with limited mobility.

The **Lille City Pass** will give you free access to this attraction. [Get your Lille City Pass!](https://www.getyourguide.com/lille-l643/lille-city-pass-48-hours-t7031/?partner_id=KPFX2L4&utm_medium=online_publisher&placement=content-middle)

![Inside Palais des Beaux Arts, you’ll mostly find fine arts, but there is some modern art to be found too](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745577061/lille-palais-des-beaux-arts-exterior-1024x683.jpg_inods2.webp)

### Enjoy the arts and antiquities at Palais des Beaux Arts

**Address:** Pl. de la République, 59000 Lille, France  
[Visit Website](https://pba.lille.fr)

If you enjoy fine arts and antiquities, a visit to _Palais des Beaux Arts_ will feel like all your Christmases have come at once. Inside its stately galleries, you’ll find paintings by Rembrandt, Goya, Delacroix and Rodin to name but four. The building itself is grand and intimidating and, if you go whilst its dark outside, the dim lighting inside sets quite a mood.

For those who wouldn’t necessarily consider themselves fans of fine art (that’ll be me), there are some modern art pieces on display too, as well as a carousel of temporary exhibits that may spark some interest.

The **Lille City Pass** will give you free access to this attraction. [Get your Lille City Pass!](https://www.getyourguide.com/lille-l643/lille-city-pass-48-hours-t7031/?partner_id=KPFX2L4&utm_medium=online_publisher&placement=content-middle)

![A cafe scene, not necessarily located in Lille](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745577056/lille-language-cafe-1024x683.jpg_vwlbxl.webp)

### Practice languages at the Language Cafe

**Address:** Variable  
[Visit Website](https://singafrance.com/se-rencontrer/cafes-des-langues-a-lille/)

Periodically throughout the year, an organisation called Singa arranges a free Language Cafe. At the time of writing, the most recent example occurred in April 2024 at the Bazaar St-So Co-Working space.

While there is a slant towards the practice and teaching of French, anyone of any language is welcome to attend. Pre-registration is required, so [head to the website](https://singafrance.com/se-rencontrer/cafes-des-langues-a-lille/) where you’ll find a link to the registration form, which itself contains information on the next event.

![Passage des Trois Anguilles is Lille’s narrowest street](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1744196690/lille-passage-des-trois-anguilles-683x1024.jpeg_lpk9lp.webp)

### Visit Vieux-Ville (Old Town) and squeeze down the Passage des Trois Anguilles

The cobbled streets of Lille’s Old Town are normally busy for a reason. From _La Grand Place_, wander along _Rue Esquermoise_ and you’ll encounter storefront after storefront of cute boutiques and shops, independent cafes who take their coffee very seriously and welcoming bistros with steamed up windows. As you walk along, narrow alleyways and streets lead off invitingly – don’t be afraid to get lost, it’s easy to find your way back. _Vieux-Ville_ is ideal for the casual explorer with no where in particular to go.

Whilst you’re in the area, try to find _Passage des Trois Anguilles_. It’s the narrowest street in the city.

![Outside Lille Métropole Museum of Modern, Contemporary and Outsider Art, you’ll find large sculptures. Inside, there’s plenty of galleries to explore](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745577055/lille-lam-gallery-1024x683.jpeg_uejcoa.webp)

### Visit the LaM (Lille Métropole Museum of Modern, Contemporary and Outsider Art)

**Address:** 1 All. du Musée, 59650 Villeneuve-d’Ascq, France  
[Visit Website](https://www.musee-lam.fr/)

Located in neighbouring _Villeneuve-d’Ascq_ (which itself is a part of the greater Lille metropolitan area), LaM is home to over 4500 pieces of art from the 20th and 21st centuries. Galleries are bright and minimalist and full of paintings, sculptures, photography and electronic media. Outside, you’ll find some much larger sculptures nestled amidst the greenery of the garden.

The museum has a car park, but for most visitors, you’ll want either bus 32 or L6. Whilst you’re in the area, you might like to grab a breather in _Parc du Héron_, an enormous green space just to the south of the museum.

## Things to do in Roubaix

![One of the best things to do in Lille is visiting La Piscine](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745577054/lille-la-piscine-1024x683.jpeg_iuyau1.webp)

### See the art deco interior of La Piscine Museum

**Address:** 23 Rue de l’Espérance, 59100 Roubaix, France  
[Visit Website](http://www.roubaix-lapiscine.com/)

There’s always something super exciting about a brand new museum, but this one is particularly special. Opened in 2001, La Piscine (as the name might suggest) is set inside a former swimming baths where its breathtaking Art Deco interior has been wonderfully restored and accentuated. This really is one of the best things to do in Lille.

The museum’s permanent collection includes fine arts, industrial artefacts and cultural heritage. New galleries have been constructed to house some of the exhibits, but the headline really is the former pool house. Wander through a former changing cubicle and you emerge into a hall that’s bookended by stunning stained glass windows. Photos really don’t do any justice to how beautiful it is in real life.

Metro line 2 runs from Lille city centre all the way to Roubaix. For La Piscine alight at _Gare Jean Lebas_ and wander a short distance down _Av. Jean Lebas_ (on the way, you’ll pass the tourist office). You can also take the tram or bus, but it’s much slower.

The **Lille City Pass** will give you free access to this attraction. [Get your Lille City Pass!](https://www.getyourguide.com/lille-l643/lille-city-pass-48-hours-t7031/?partner_id=KPFX2L4&utm_medium=online_publisher&placement=content-middle)

![Le Grand Bassin is a creator collective and store](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745577056/lille-le-grand-bassin-1024x683.jpeg_fexjka.webp)

### Shop for quirky artisan crafts at Le Grand Bassin

**Address:** 27 Rue de l’Espérance, 59100 Roubaix, France  
[Visit Website](http://www.legrandbassin.fr/)

Right next door to La Piscine is _La Grand Bassin_, a makers collective and concept store. Inside, 50 creators have their wares on display and available for purchase for pretty reasonable prices. There’s some wonderfully quirky and unique stuff available, so take your time to browse and to appreciate how diverse and alive the local artistic community is.

## Plan & Book your visit to Lille, France

We hope you found our list of things to do in Lille useful. In this section, we’ll go through how you can plan and book your visit to Lille. As you’ll quickly discover, Lille is very easy to get to and even easier to get around.

### Trains to Lille

For many visitors, arriving by train will be the best option.

Lille is very well connected by rail to cities across Europe, not just on regular train lines but on high-speed lines that stretch across France, across the border to Belgium and The Netherlands and of course, underneath the English Channel (_la Manche_) to London.

We took the [Eurostar from London](https://go.skimresources.com?id=85974X1563631&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetrainline.com%2Fen%2Ftrain-companies%2Feurostar), through the Channel Tunnel, arriving at _Gare de Lille-Europe_ which is right in the city centre. It really couldn’t have been easier.

_Before booking your train tickets, do check to see if taking the bus is a better option for you (see below for details). For some journeys, it’s both quicker (or at least comparably quick) and considerably cheaper to take the bus._

Booking your train tickets in advance not only brings peace of mind, it also often means you pay the lowest fare. To find the best value train tickets to Lille from anywhere, we recommend [Trainline](https://go.skimresources.com?id=85974X1563631&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetrainline.com%2Fen%2Fdestinations%2Ftrains-to-lille).

[Find train tickets](https://go.skimresources.com?id=85974X1563631&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetrainline.com%2Fen%2Fdestinations%2Ftrains-to-lille)

### Flights to Lille

_Aéroport de Lille_ operates mostly domestic flights though there are some international flights to/from Poland, Portugal and the Canary Islands.

Train services to/from Lille are so competitive is terms of both service and price that we wouldn’t recommend flying into Lille unless it really can’t be avoided.

If you really do have to fly, [Skyscanner](https://go.skimresources.com?id=85974X1563631&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skyscanner.net%2Fflights-to%2Flil%2Fcheap-flights-to-lille-airport.html) is a great place to start your search for the best prices on flights to Lille. They compare fares from multiple airlines and travel agents all at once and they make finding more eco-friendly operators very easy.

[Find flights to Lille](https://go.skimresources.com?id=85974X1563631&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skyscanner.net%2Fflights-to%2Flil%2Fcheap-flights-to-lille-airport.html)

### Transfers from the airport

A Shuttle Bus is in operation, taking flight passengers to/from the city centre in around 20 minutes. Timetables fit around flight times but generally, buses leave the terminal every 30 minutes and drop off right in the city centre.

### Buses to Lille

Long distance buses operate numerous services a day to Lille from Paris, London, Brussels and further afield. Prices are at worst, competitive and at best, a steal. In fact, in many cases, taking the bus is probably better than taking the train.

[Search and compare bus fares with Busbud](https://go.skimresources.com?id=85974X1563631&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.busbud.com%2Fen-gb%2Fbus-lille%2Fc%2Fu140jc), which offers comprehensive and up-to-date timetable and ticket price information for destinations all over the world.

### Getting around Lille

Driverless trains, buses and trams combine to create one of the best integrated urban transport networks in Europe. Getting around is both easy and good value (particularly if you have a [Lille City Pass](https://www.getyourguide.com/lille-l643/lille-city-pass-48-hours-t7031/?partner_id=KPFX2L4&utm_medium=online_publisher&placement=content-middle)).

Tickets for the transport network can be purchased from vending machines that provide English language instructions.

The city centre is quite compact and easily explored on foot. Much of the city centre has been partially pedestrianised. For those with limited mobility, the city centre is mostly flat, though there are a lot of cobbled streets.

The **Lille City Pass** will give you free and unlimited use of the public transport network as well as free access to 29 of Lille’s top attractions.

### Places to stay in Lille

As you might expect with Lille being a large city, there are plenty of places to stay during your trip to suit all kinds of budget.

We stayed at the [Queen Christine guesthouse](https://go.skimresources.com?id=85974X1563631&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Fhotel%2Ffr%2Fqueen-christine.en-gb.html) in the neighbouring city of _Villeneuve-d’Ascq_, which is directly connected to Lille city centre by Metro line 2. The guesthouse is run by Christine who has carefully designed each of the four guest rooms in tasteful and unique styles. The room designs have caught a lot of attention, having been featured in style magazines. Continental breakfast in included in the price, though the only vegan option was fresh bread and homemade jams (which were all wonderful).

Our choice in the city centre would have to be [Mama Shelter](https://go.skimresources.com?id=85974X1563631&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Fhotel%2Ffr%2Fmama-shelter-lille.en-gb.html), which is located close to Lille Europe station. Rooms are contemporary and quirky and come with free Wifi, a mini fridge, a safe, luxury bedding, free streaming movies and organic, solid soaps. The hotel is skewed towards adults with some rather kinky special offers available on their website.

For general accommodation searches, we recommend [Tripadvisor](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=5986&awinaffid=138444&clickref=lille&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.co.uk%2FHotels-g187178-Lille_Nord_Hauts_de_France-Hotels.html).
