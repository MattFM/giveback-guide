We want Giveback Guide to change the way people travel for the better. Better not only for communities, wildlife and the planet, but also for travellers themselves.

To achieve this, we need to be influential, not only to individuals just like you, but to the broader tourism industry.

Before we start to see such change, we need to focus on growth.

We can measure growth in a number of ways, and believe me, we’re doing just that. In this short update however, we’re focusing on one metric: number of projects.

When we [launched our brand new website recently](https://giveback.guide/blog/our-new-website/), we hoped that the technology behind the site would allow us to publish projects much more quickly than before. I’m delighted to say that that objective has been realised and we’ve been able to start processing the backlog much more efficiently.

And that brings me to the announcement itself.

I’m delighted to announce that we’ve just published [our 300th project](https://giveback.guide/projects/jacks-cat-cafe/). In doing so, we also launched our 60th country. 

And, we’ve already surpassed both milestones. It really won’t be long before we’re announcing another one.

We’re super happy that our new website is enabling us to bring more incredible projects to light, encouraging more people to engage with them.

We hope that as we continue to publish more projects, it will encourage more people to join our movement.

If you haven’t done so already, please do [join our community](https://giveback.guide/join/). We’d love to have you on board.
