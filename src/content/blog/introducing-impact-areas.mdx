We know that you care about making a positive difference when you travel. But with hundreds of projects and stays in our database to choose from, how do you find the ones that truly align with *your* values?

Maybe you're passionate about animal welfare. Or perhaps you want to support women's empowerment initiatives. You might be drawn to reforestation projects, or eager to help preserve cultural heritage in the places you visit.

Whatever causes matter most to you, **we've just made it much easier to find travel experiences that create real impact in those areas**.


## What are Impact Areas?

Impact Areas are the heart and soul of what makes each project and stay on Giveback Guide special. In short, they help you to identify the specific ways that your travel choices can create positive change for people, places and the planet.

There are **19 Impact Areas** across three main categories:

- **Environmental & Conservation** – Protecting ecosystems, wildlife, and natural resources
- **Social Justice & Inclusion** – Creating opportunities for marginalised communities
- **Community & Development** – Strengthening local economies and preserving culture

Each project and stay on our platform has been tagged with the Impact Areas it contributes to, so you can instantly see exactly what difference you'll be making.


## Why this matters

Impact Areas give you clarity and help you to make more informed choices. Instead of scrolling through hundreds of options hoping to find something that resonates, you can:

- **Instantly see the impact you could have** - Passionate about LGBTQ+ inclusion? Want to support disability empowerment? Now you can find exactly what you're looking for.
- **Discover new ways to make a difference** - You might arrive looking for animal welfare projects and leave inspired by marine protection or cultural heritage preservation.
- **Make informed choices** - Many experiences contribute to multiple Impact Areas, giving you even more ways to create positive change.


## Real, measurable impact

Every Impact Area designation is carefully considered. Whether a project directly contributes to a cause, allocates proceeds to support it, provides education about the issue, or partners with local organisations in the field, we do our best to make sure the impact is real.

This means you can travel with confidence, knowing that your time, energy, and money are going toward causes that truly matter to you.
