Dundee is just one of those cities that we instantly love. Compact, underrated, on-the-rise, yet also understated.

Dundee isn’t a boastful city, even though is could be. There’s stacks to see and do in the city centre, and with recent and ongoing development of its northern shore to the River Tay, the city has the buzz of a place that has aspirations of higher things.

We visited without really knowing what to expect (Dundee isn’t a city you hear much about), but we went away having had a great time and keen to share what we’d experienced.

## Best things to do in Dundee, Scotland

For a compact city, Dundee has a surprisingly long list of things to see and do. Here are our recommendations, based on our own experiences of visiting the city.

![V&A Dundee has plenty to see and access to most of it is free](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1744196458/dundee-va-exterior-1024x682.jpg_nhns0j.webp)

### V&A Dundee

**Address:** 1 Riverside Esplanade, Dundee DD1 4EZ  
[Visit Website](https://www.vam.ac.uk/dundee)

Opened in 2018, the £80.1m V&A (Victoria and Albert) is Scotland’s first museum dedicated to design. The building itself, designed by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, is striking and well worth walking around either before or after your visit inside. When you are inside, you’ll discover a series of permanent exhibits (such as Charles Rennie Mackintosh’s remarkable Oak Room), as well as one or two temporary exhibitions. Entry to the permanent collection is free, while there’s a charge for everything else.

The bright and airy Tatha Bar &  Restaurant (1st floor) has a handful of veggie/vegan options and a lovely outdoor terrace with views of the River Tay and the RRS Discovery in its adjacent dry dock.

### **The McManus: Dundee’s Art Gallery and Museum**

**Address:** Albert Square, Meadowside, Dundee DD1 1DA  
[Visit Website](http://www.mcmanus.co.uk/)

Fans of fine and decorative art will love The McManus, as will fans of Gothic Rivival-style architecture. The exterior of the category A listed building is quite stunning, thanks in part to a multi-million pound restoration in 2007. The collections range from paintings to historic artefacts that chart the story of Dundee. Entry is free.

### Dundee Law

**Address:** Law Rd, Dundee DD3  
[Visit Website](https://www.dundeecity.gov.uk/service-area/corporate-services/democratic-and-legal-services/dundee-law)

Around 400 million years ago, volcanic activity resulted in the creation of a 174 m (571 ft) hill. Today, that hill provides fabulous views of much of Dundee and the River Tay and is known to locals as Dundee Law. Other than a large war memorial, a car park and an aerial, there’s not a lot to do at the top, other than enjoy the views and congratulate yourself on reaching the top (assuming you walked).

You can reach the top by car, but you’ll feel a greater sense of achievement if you walk (30 minutes from the city centre). Thanks to the road network, getting there on foot is a little bit tricky. Google Maps will get you there, with a little bit of extra thinking on your part.

### HMS Unicorn

**Address:** Victoria Dock, Dundee DD1 3BP  
[Visit Website](http://www.hmsunicorn.org.uk/)

The 20 year old HMS Unicorn is, according to those who maintain her, “the most original old ship in the world.” Incredibly, the Unicorn is still afloat in the city’s Victoria Dock. Visitors are welcome to explore the multiple decks, some of which go surprisingly deep and have back-creakingly low ceilings (tall people, you’ve been warned). As well as collections of original artefacts, there’s also a really interesting exhibition on Mermaids and monsters from the deep.

### Dundee Contemporary Arts

**Address:** 152 Nethergate, Dundee DD1 4DY  
[Visit Website](http://www.dca.org.uk/)

Dundee Contemporary Arts is a cultural centre with gallery spaces, a cinema, workshops and a cafe. With a free ticket (which you can buy either in advance online or in person on arrival) you can access whichever exhibitions happen to be on during your visit. By their own admission, some of the exhibitions “can often be strange and unusual,” a statement we can certainly attest to.

As you’d expect, charges apply to visit the cinema, which screens a wide range of arthouse and (occasionally) mainstream films.

### Getting around Dundee

Dundee is a small city and very easy to explore on foot. If you’re travelling outside of the city centre, good value and reliable buses are available, or you can hire a taxi.

For those with limited mobility, the city centre if mostly flat, but steep hills lie to the north as you head towards Dundee Law.

### Hotels and Holiday Homes in Dundee

Dundee has a few good accommodation options, with most of the best options being provided by chain hotels.

During our visit, we stayed at [Premier Inn Dundee Centre](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=5986&awinaffid=138444&clickref=dundee&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.co.uk%2FHotel_Review-g186518-d570481-Reviews-Premier_Inn_Dundee_Centre_Hotel-Dundee_Scotland.html). We don’t make a habit of staying in Premier Inns, but we were pretty delighted with this brand new, purpose-built hotel. The price was pretty unbeatable and the location, right on the banks of the River Tay and immediately next to the V&A Dundee, was spot on.

Other options we’d consider are [Sleeperz Hotel Dundee](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=5986&awinaffid=138444&clickref=dundee&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.co.uk%2FHotel_Review-g186518-d14165883-Reviews-Sleeperz_Hotel_Dundee-Dundee_Scotland.html), which sits directly above the city’s main railway station and [Hotel Indigo Dundee](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=5986&awinaffid=138444&clickref=dundee&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.co.uk%2FHotel_Review-g186518-d14076711-Reviews-Hotel_Indigo_Dundee_an_IHG_hotel-Dundee_Scotland.html), which offers smarter, contemporary rooms, though at higher rates.
