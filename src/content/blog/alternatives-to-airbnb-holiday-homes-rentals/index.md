In this post, we aim to show you that there are alternatives to Airbnb. You just need to know where to look.

The slow and cautious reopening of tourism around the world has come at a time when most would be considering their options for holidays anyway. As such, there’s been quite a rush on available accommodation with many places in more popular destinations selling out fast.

For those seeking holiday homes and home rentals, Airbnb is the ubiquitous option for most (easily demonstrated by the word, ‘Airbnb’ now often being used as a moniker for, ‘holiday home’). As such, availability on Airbnb over the coming few months is running out.

Thankfully, there are alternatives to Airbnb that you can try out if you are having difficulty finding somewhere to stay. We’ve chosen a selection of these options for you and we present them to you below.

### Plum Guide

Whilst many of the accommodation booking sites fight it out over which has the most listings in their databases, Plum Guide is doing things a little differently. Rather than focusing on quantity, their focus is on quality. Using a stringent vetting system, Plum Guide, “don’t list a lot of homes \[…\] just the right ones.” As you might expect, prices are a little higher than on other sites, but you generally get what you pay for and it doesn’t mean there aren’t still bargains to be found.
