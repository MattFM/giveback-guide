## Best vegan cafes and restaurants in Dundee, Scotland

Veggies and vegans needn’t worry about going thirsty or hungry in Dundee. The city has lots of really great options for us.

We’ve listed a few of the places we visited during our visit below, but do [check out HappyCow](https://www.happycow.net/europe/scotland/dundee/) for even more options.

### Loca Rita’s

**Address:** Old Hawkhill, Dundee DD1 5EU  
[See on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/loco_ritas_dundee/)

A vibrant and youthful-feeling 100% vegan Mexican cantina and bar on the periphery of the city centre. The 100% vegan menu contains delicious antojitos (small plates), tacos and loaded fries, with frozen mojitos to wash everything down. Everything we tasted was fresh, good value and beautifully presented.

### Serendipities

**Address:** 12 Union St, Dundee DD1 4BH  
[Visit Website](http://www.serendipities.co.uk/)

Quirky Serendipities is a 100% vegan social enterprise cafe located in the city centre. The organisation that runs the cafe provides locals with learning disabilities, autism and mental health barriers the opportunity to train and develop their skills by working.

![Awesome pizza with a decent selection of veggie/vegan varieties](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745839635/dundee-luigis-pizza-1024x683.jpg_zus9bn.webp)

### Luigi’s Pizzeria

**Address:** 21 Strathmartine Rd, Dundee DD3 7RL  
[Visit Website](http://www.luigispizzeria.co.uk/)

We chanced upon vegan-friendly Luigi’s on our way back down from Dundee Law (see above). There are five excellent, authentically-made veg/vegan pizzas on the menu, plus a handful of sides and desserts. The homemade cashew cheese is made on site and tastes great. If you’re not in the area and/or don’t fancy the uphill walk from the city centre, download their app for deliveries.

Can be rather busy, but definitely worth the wait. Takeaways/deliveries only.

![FIKA, Dundee offers a decent number of veggie/vegan breakfasts and lunches](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745839629/dundee-fika-1024x683.jpg_fya7dp.webp)

### FIKA

**Address:** 75 Perth Rd, Dundee DD1 4HY  
[Visit Website](http://www.fikadundee.co.uk/)

A cute, local spot for vegan-friendly breakfasts and lunches with a decent selection of vegan choices. Between 1000-1400, a vegan sharing board is available. We found this to be a little bit pricey for what it was, but we still enjoyed it (especially the vegan croissant). The other options might be better value.

![Abandon Ship has an alternative vibe and is popular with locals](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745839628/dundee-abandon-ship-1024x683.jpg_tfuwpa.webp)

### Abandon Ship

**Address:** 2b Whitehall Cres, Dundee DD1 4AU  
[Visit Website](http://abandonshipbar.com)

A lively and popular vegan-friendly bar with 30-somethings and those with a slightly alternative leaning. An extensive drinks menu (with lots of house cocktails) is supported by a decent selection of vegan bar snacks. We heartily recommend the Spit Roasted Pineapple gin and tonic with a side of cauliflower bites.

### Notable Mentions

- Vegan-friendly **Flame Tree Cafe** (20 Exchange St) offers a separate plant-based menu of bagels, rolls and ‘stuff on toast’. We can personally recommend the rainbow bagels.

- Despite the name, **Vegana Cafe** (127 Nethergate) is a vegetarian cafe with vegan-friendly options, including breakfasts, burgers and pasta dishes. Vegana looks like it’s opened very recently (May 2023) – we’re sure it will soon become a firm favourite with local vegans.
