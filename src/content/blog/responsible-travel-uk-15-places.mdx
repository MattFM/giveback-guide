When you search for responsible travel in the UK, you mostly find expensive tour operators.
But what if you’re not looking to book a tour and you instead want to explore independently?

At [Giveback Guide](https://giveback.guide), our approach to responsible tourism is to provide individuals with alternative choices to the things they’d do anyway whilst on a trip.

When we’re visiting somewhere new (or even exploring our own local area), we all go out for lunch, we all grab a coffee, we visit attractions, go on tours and immerse ourselves in the local culture. 

Giveback Guide has hundreds of options to do all of these things, albeit responsibly. It’s then down to you to make easy swaps and make a positive impact on your travels.

In this guide, we highlight 15 diverse responsible travel projects across the UK, including cafes, animal sanctuaries, community projects and conservation initiatives. 


## **What makes a project 'responsible'?**

Not all travel experiences are created equal. 

The projects featured in this guide (and more widely, on [Giveback Guide](https://giveback.guide)) have been carefully checked to ensure they genuinely benefit local communities, animals, and/or the environment. 

You won't find commercial tour operators or greenwashing here (or at least, we really hope not). These are just authentic projects where your visit creates a real, positive impact. 


## **Projects in England**

Let’s now explore 15 amazing hand-selected responsible travel places in the UK, starting with projects and stays in England.

By the end of your session, you'll leave with new skills, recipes to recreate at home, and a deeper appreciation for the rich culinary heritage that migrants bring to the UK. It's a warm, engaging experience that goes far beyond a typical cooking class.

Simply approach a member of the Shoreside team and ask, and they'll be happy to provide you with everything you need to get started.

[Unseen Tours](https://giveback.guide/projects/unseen-tours/) builds on this by supporting vulnerably housed individuals to lead guided walks across London neighbourhoods.

Since 2010, over 24 guides have led walks in eight areas, running 450+ walks annually for 6500+ guests.

Formerly homeless guides share intimate street knowledge and local history. Your ticket supports their livelihood whilst challenging perceptions about homelessness.

Most of these gentle animals absolutely love receiving biscuits and attention from visitors, making for a truly heartwarming and therapeutic experience.

## **Why you should visit all four nations in the UK**

The UK's responsible travel scene is incredibly diverse, stretching from [rewilding projects near Inverness](https://giveback.guide/projects/dundreggan-rewilding-centre/) to [monkey sanctuaries in Cornwall](https://giveback.guide/projects/monkey-sanctuary-looe/). By exploring projects across different regions, you'll discover how each part of the country tackles social and environmental challenges in its own unique way. 

Think of it as building your own responsible travel road trip, one that mixes bustling city initiatives with peaceful rural conservation work. You might spend Saturday morning relaxing in a [community sauna in Devon](https://giveback.guide/projects/devon-community-sauna-cic/), then find yourself in joining a [refugee-led cookery class in Bristol](https://giveback.guide/projects/migrateful/) by the afternoon. 

Whether you're planning short weekend escapes or a longer journey across the UK, connecting multiple projects creates a richer, more meaningful travel experience.

Planning to visit several projects in multiple locations? Here's how to organise your itinerary...

## **How to plan your responsible travel itinerary**

Once you start engaging in responsible travel options, it quickly becomes very difficult to stop. Take it from us. We started seeking projects to engage with a few years ago and got so into it, we ended up creating [Giveback Guide](https://giveback.guide).


### **The problem**

There are hundreds of positive impact projects all over the country, but how do you keep track of them all?

- Saving travel tips in random places (Notes, Instagram saves, browser bookmarks) isn’t usually an effective plan
- You end up losing them when you actually plan a trip
- There’s no way to organise all your saves and bookmarks by destination or impact area


### **The solution: Custom save lists on Giveback Guide**

Thankfully, Giveback Guide has a solution for you.

Since our initial launch, we’ve been making it easy to discover fantastic responsible travel options all over the UK. Now though, we’re delighted to offer everyone a way to save the stays and projects they’re interested in to their own custom save lists.

You can even keep track of the projects you’ve engaged with by marking them as ‘Visited’.

The best thing is that it’s completely free to [create an account and get started](https://giveback.guide/login/).


### How does it work?

Creating custom save lists on Giveback Guide is really easy. All you need to do is…

1. [Sign up for your free Giveback Guide account](https://giveback.guide/login/). This takes about 2 minutes.
2. When you log in for the first time, we’ll take you to your new dashboard. Here, you can create your first custom save list.
3. Search or browse our database of hundreds of stays and projects all over the world.
4. When you find a stay or project you like the sound of, hit ‘Save’ and save the listings to the save list you created (or create a new list)

It really is as easy as that!

## **Tips for responsible travel in the UK**

Making your UK travels more responsible doesn't require you to make drastic changes. It’s about making just a few thoughtful choices that amplify your positive impact. 

Here are some practical tips to help you get the most out of your visits to such projects.


### **Travel by public transport**

Check the location of your chosen project and see whether you can get their by public transport. Trains and buses not only reduce your carbon footprint but they often provide a more relaxing way to travel.


### **Book directly**

Whenever possible, try to contact projects directly rather than booking through third-party platforms. This ensures more of your money goes straight to the organisation. Whilst you're visiting, consider supporting other local businesses in the area too. Grab lunch at a nearby independent café or stay at a locally owned B&B (Giveback Guide has [lots of these listed already](https://giveback.guide/projects/)).


### Be respectful of team members

Many of these projects are run by small teams or volunteers who are passionate about their work but have limited capacity. Always check visiting hours in advance, book ahead if required, and be understanding if plans change. If a visit is free or donation-based, consider contributing what you can. Even a few pounds makes a real difference to grassroots initiatives.


### **Share your experience**

One of the most valuable things you can do is spread the word. Leave honest reviews, share photos on social media, and tell friends about your experience. For smaller projects especially, word-of-mouth recommendations are really appreciated. Your post might inspire someone else to visit, creating a ripple effect of positive impact.


### **Plan around seasons**

Some projects have reduced hours during winter months or are seasonal by nature (like outdoor conservation work). Check websites or call ahead, especially if you're travelling from afar. This also helps you time your visit to when they need support most.


### **Build your own green tourism journey**

Rather than seeing these as isolated stops, consider how you might link several projects together into a longer trip. A weekend in Cornwall could include both the [beach clean at Carlyon Bay](https://giveback.guide/projects/shoreside-at-carlyon/) and a visit to another nearby conservation project. Scotland's Highlands offer multiple rewilding and animal sanctuary experiences within driving distance of each other. This approach to green tourism in the UK lets you dive deeper into the regions you visit whilst maximising your positive impact.
