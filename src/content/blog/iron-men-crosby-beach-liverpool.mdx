We found ourselves at [Crosby Beach](https://www.visitsouthport.com/things-to-do/crosby-beach-p244561) in Merseyside (the English county in which [Liverpool](http://www.visitliverpool.com/) is located) on a particularly blustery day. We had come for a very particular reason, though at first, we had trouble finding it.

Having parked our car, we staggered our way up the steep sand dunes that separated the beach from the neighbouring parkland. A stiff breeze blew the dry sand in our eyes and scratched our cheeks. Once we’d crested the dune, we headed down to the beach and the winds eased.

The tide was out, so the beach was a vast, featureless expanse. It was peaceful and there was hardly anyone else about. As we walked along the beach, it slowly became apparent we were no longer alone.

One hundred iron men had joined us, spaced liberally across the beach from the water’s edge to the land and stretching out in front of us for 3.2km (2 miles). Each iron man faced the water and was identical and emotionless.

Gloomy scenes from Crosby Beach

The statues, part of an installation called ’[Another Place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_Place)‘ are cast replicas of the artist himself, [Anthony Gormley](http://www.antonygormley.com/). Whilst the presence of the statues caused some local controversy at the time of their installation, they are now an important part of the area’s tourism industry and draw people in from all over the world, keen to share in the statue’s motionless stoicism.


## How to see the Iron Men of Crosby Beach

The statues are a permanent feature of Crosby beach and can be seen **all year round**. You can either drive (use postcode *L23 6SX*) or you can take the train from *Liverpool Central* station to *Blundellsands* (only 20 minutes). Upon arriving at *Blundellsands*, the attraction is a short stroll away.

You can buy train tickets up until departure from *Liverpool Central* or you can [buy your tickets in advance from Trainline](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=85974X1563631&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetrainline.com%2Fstations%2Fblundellsands-and-crosby).


## Stay safe and be prepared

For safety, visitors are advised to keep within 50 metres of the promenade and to not attempt to reach statues in or near the water. Tides can change quickly, so keep safe!

Sand will almost certainly be soft and wet, so make sure you wear suitable footwear.


## While you’re there, do something amazing

If you time your visit well, you can do something amazing by engaging with the local community and by giving back to the beach ecosystem.

Once a month on a Sunday, Friends of Crosby Beach arrange a [beach clean-up event](https://giveback.guide/projects/friends-crosby-beach/) that’s open to all willing volunteers and completely free to get involved with. All equipment and a safety briefing is provided. This is a great opportunity to meet new people and leave the beach in a better state than you found it.
