Ecobnb have ten main criteria that each property has to meet before they get listed on the site, including 100% renewable energy, ecological cleaning products and more than 80% of waste recycled.

### Cool Stays

Cool Stays makes it super easy to find eco holiday homes amongst its thousands of global listings. We weren’t able to find any details as to whether Cool Stays has specific criteria on what is defined as ‘eco-friendly’, so you’ll need to have a read of each property’s description to determine whether it’s really cutting the mustard.

Many of the properties that were listed under the ‘eco-friendly’ category certainly appeared to be meeting or exceeding our sustainability requirements, so it’s certainly worth a look.

### Host Unusual

If unique and quirky stays is more your thing, you’ll love Host Unusual. There are house boats, yurts, tree houses and even horse boxes on offer, each tagged with the site’s ‘Eco Stays’ category. There are hundreds of options to chose from, located all over the world (do check the map).

Similarly to Cool Stays (above), it’s not immediately clear how a property gets tagged as an ‘eco stay’, so do read the descriptions. Host Unusual has however signed up to Ecologi to offset the emissions of their team’s personal and professional lives, which does show some commitment to tackling the climate crisis.

### Unique Homestays

For those with a bit more money to spend, Unique Homestays have a special category for the luxury UK-based homes in their inventory that are sustainably designed and feature eco technology. Prices are considerably higher than you’ll see on the other sites in this list, but you do get some super-fancy places to stay in return for your hard-earned dosh.

One thing to keep in mind is that many of the eco holiday homes in the list house between 8-12 people, so once you factor that in, the prices do become a little more reasonable.

UK-based conservation charity National Trust operate a number of their own holiday homes, each fitted with solar panels and eco-friendly heating ‘without compromising on comfort or style’.
