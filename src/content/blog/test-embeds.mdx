This is a test blog post to demonstrate the new embed components for projects and stays.

## Project Embeds

Here's an example of a project embed for Zero Waste Apeldoorn:

<ProjectEmbed slug="zero-waste-apeldoorn" />

And here's another project, the Enabling Village in Singapore:

<ProjectEmbed slug="enabling-village-singapore" />

## Stay Embed

Here's an example of a stay embed for Bikki's Jungle Homestay:

<StayEmbed slug="bikkis-jungle-homestay" />

## How It Works

These embeds are automatically available in all blog posts without needing to import them. They:

- Display a thumbnail image with verification badge
- Show the title, operator/property name, and location
- Include a brief excerpt from the description
- Link directly to the full project/stay page
- Are fully responsive and accessible

You can use them by simply writing `<ProjectEmbed slug="your-slug" />` or `<StayEmbed slug="your-slug" />` anywhere in your MDX content.
