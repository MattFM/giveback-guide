The political situation on the island of Cyprus is _**complex**_. Decades of _scepticism, misunderstanding and stalemate_ has lead to an island literally divided from shore to shore and kept in a _peaceful state_ by the presence international forces.

Despite the tensions, **over 4 million tourists** still flock to Cyprus each year seeking hot, _sunny_ weather, long stretches of _sandy beaches_ and _sparkling_, blue Mediterranean waters. Most of them find what they’re looking for south of the dividing line in the many resort towns on the Southern coast.

Just _10%_ of them venture across the border into **North Cyprus**.

In this post, we’re going to assume that you’ve _already considered_ visiting or, at the very least, you _want to know more_ about this segregated and disputed part of Europe.

Hopefully, we’ll be able to **satisfy your curiosity** and convince you that any visit to North Cyprus will be _fun, fascinating, safe and comfortable_.

## A Brief Modern History of North Cyprus

One year that you’ll see and hear _plenty_ of reference to in the run up to, and during your visit is **1974**. This is the year _everything changed_ on the island of Cyprus.

It was the year a military coup d’état by the Greek Army was attempted. Turkey’s response was to send in its forces, eventually taking control of about one third of the island. Hundreds of thousands of Greek & Turkish Cypriots ended up being displaced from their homes.

By the end of the year, the Greek military junta had collapsed and a ceasefire was agreed. The ceasefire line eventually became a **UN buffer zone**, which is still in place today.

The _Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus_ is now the _de facto_ state to the north of the UN buffer zone (or ‘_Green Line_‘ as it is known). Turkey is the only country to recognise the state, whilst the rest of the international community see’s North Cyprus as part of the Republic of Cyprus and Turkey’s continued military presence as an illegal occupation.

Attempts to find a solution to the Cyprus dispute have so far been unsuccessful.

****Disambiguation:**** In this post, I will refer to land to the north and south of the UN buffer zone (or ‘__Green Line__‘) that divides the island. In order for readers to easily differentiate between the two, I will refer to the land to the north, the __de facto__ Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, as ****North Cyprus**** and the land to the south, the __de jure__ Republic of Cyprus, as ****Southern Cyprus****.

So, now that you know a little about how North Cyprus came to be, let’s dive into the details. Here’s a summary of everything we think you should know before visiting North Cyprus.

![Flying into Cyprus from London Luton (LTN) by budget airline, Wizz Air.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1744196814/north-cyprus-wizz-air.jpg_agvzmk.webp)

## Getting to and from North Cyprus

[Ercan International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ercan_International_Airport) is the primary international airport in North Cyprus. Despite flights to the airport being internationally banned, aeroplanes do come and go, though **only via Turkey**.

The government of the _Republic of Cyprus_, who governs the area to the south of the UN buffer zone, considers anyone who has entered via Ercan airport to have **entered the country illegally**. This is certainly worth considering, especially if you’re keen to visit _Southern Cyprus_ during your visit. You may encounter _serious problems_ if you attempt to cross the border.

While you’ll find flight prices are **pretty unbeatable** to and from Ercan, you’ll find [options with more flexibility and _considerably more direct flights_ to and from Larnaca airport](https://go.skimresources.com?id=85974X1563631&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skyscanner.net%2Fflights-to%2Flca%2Fcheap-flights-to-larnaca-airport.html) in _Southern Cyprus_.

## Transferring from Larnaca to North Cyprus

We had pre-arranged a transfer from Larnaca airport to our hotel in North Cyprus via the _Pyla/Pergamos_ crossing point. Starting on the Greek side, our car crossed through [British Sovereign Base Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrotiri_and_Dhekelia) territory (land containing a British military base) and then the UN buffer zone (though you wouldn’t have necessarily noticed). Our car stopped _only once_ at the Turkish checkpoint where our passports were inspected. Pretty uneventful.

One the way back, our passports were checked again by Turkish forces as we left. The car then stopped again as we re-entered the _British Sovereign Base Area_, where we were questioned by a customs official about our luggage. The questions were _mildly_ confrontational, perhaps demonstrating the tense atmosphere between the two sides. It was certainly weird for us as Brits to be questioned so _rigorously_ by someone effectively working for the UK government.

One _important thing to remember_ is to **keep any transfer papers** with you. If you’re not asked to complete a transfer form by your transport provider, _don’t worry_. If you are though, _keep hold of it_, as you’ll be asked for it on your return journey.

## Crossing the ‘Green Line’ in Nicosia/Lefkoşa

One of the _most common_ border crossing points between the two sides of Cyprus is on [Ledra Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledra_Street) in the capital, [Nicosia/Lefkoşa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicosia). Here, you’ll find a _fairly relaxed-looking_ pedestrian-only border crossing where you’ll be asked to present your passport by both police forces. The process is **very easy** and you’ll be across the border in _minutes_.

A less frequented, but **significantly more interesting** border crossing point can be found on [Markou Drakou](https://goo.gl/maps/ovY3BLBmRex), often referred to as the _Ledra Palace_ crossing. Here, the UN buffer zone thins to a road’s width and flags from both sides can be seen flying almost side by side. It’s one of the few places where you can wander into the UN buffer zone unopposed.

Just before the crossing itself is the [Ledra Palace Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledra_Palace_Hotel), formerly the capital’s _largest and grandest_ hotel, now marooned in no-man’s-land and repurposed as a UN headquarters. Opposite the hotel is [Home for Cooperation](http://www.home4cooperation.info/), an **awesome cafe** and cultural building whose main purpose is to serve as a place Cypriots living on both sides of the Green Line can _meet, have a coffee and engage_ in cultural performances.

It’s a **truly unique** place and _well worth_ stopping by.

## Safety

Despite political tensions, an _often-noticeable_ military presence and geographic proximity to troubled areas, North Cyprus is currently **perfectly safe** and a _vast majority_ of visitors will **experience no problems** during their visit.

The political situation is somewhat tense, but _not violent_. Crime numbers are _relatively low_ for a European destination and _statistically lower_ than those in Southern Cyprus. Just exercise the same caution as you would during a trip to any other European destination and you’ll have _nothing to worry about_.

![Road signs (right) show destinations in Turkish only in the village of Çatalköy, near Kyrenia/Girne.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1744196782/north-cyprus-catalkoy_y2qmaf.jpg)

## Language

The main language in North Cyprus is Turkish.

**Most people know or understand some English**, or know someone who does whom they can ask for help. Service staff in shops, restaurants and hotels speak good English.

Road signs, signposts and notices are generally written in both Turkish and English and occasionally Greek. German is also quite prevalent.

### Place Names in Cyprus

Since Cyprus has two main influential ethnic groups, many towns and cities in North Cyprus are **known by two names**, one of _Greek_ origin, the other of _Turkish_. For example, the popular tourist town of _Kyrenia_ (Greek origin) is also known as _Girne_ (Turkish), while the capital _Nicosia_ is also known as _Lefkoşa_.

It seemed during our visit that there’s **not a lot of consistency** with the usage of the names. Road signs generally displayed both names, but older signs only displayed the Greek variant and newer signs only displayed the Turkish. Dolmus buses (see below) generally only displayed their destinations in Turkish.

Since there’s no consistency, **it’s good practice to know names in both languages**, just in case.

## Money

The _unusual political situation_ in North Cyprus means there’s also an **unusual monetary system** in place.

The _de facto_ currency in North Cyprus is the **Turkish Lira**, though Euros, US Dollars and British Pound Sterling is also widely accepted. Despite all of the options, **we recommend paying only in Turkish Lira** as this option almost exclusively offers you the _best value_.

In more touristy areas, prices _may be displayed only in Euros_ to cater to those crossing from Southern Cyprus. If that’s the case, _just ask_ staff what the price is in Turkish Lira.

Card payments are accepted in larger shops and restaurants with smaller outlets accepting only cash. It is **always wise to have cash** on you, just in case.

**ATMs can be found easily** in built-up areas and _most of them accept foreign cards_. Almost all of them offer _English language options_, though _a small number don’t_ which can be a bit tricky. Occasionally, we found our cards were politely rejected, but there was normally more than one ATM in the vicinity from other banks that we could try. Most ATMs _dispense only Turkish Lira_, though some also dispensed both Euros and British Pound Sterling. Typically, getting cash from an ATM _will work just as it does at home_.

## Hiring a Car in North Cyprus

Hiring a car in North Cyprus is **just as straightforward** as it would be in any other European country. You can do it on the spot at service desks and hire centres, you can ask you hotel to arrange it for you or you can pre-book online. Generally, **pre-booking online gets you the best deal** and gives you piece of mind that everything is sorted out before you get there.

We used a company called Pacific who are based in Kyrenia/Girne. We were pleased with their prices and their fair fuel policy. They delivered the car directly to our hotel on time and collected it when we were done.

### Car Insurance

Hiring a car in Cyprus has one additional complication that you’ll need to think about. Generally speaking, **car’s hired in the south can only be driven in the south and cars hired in the north can only be driven in the north**. There are some companies that offer additional insurance policies for both territories, so look into that if you’re planning on driving across the border.

### Driving

As a result of former British colonial rule, drivers across Cyprus **drive on the left**. When hiring a car, expect the steering wheel to be on the right hand side.

Road signs are _the same as those found across Europe_ with additional information written in Turkish and English. Place names are written using a mixture of Turkish and Greek, so it’s best to know both variants of your destination’s name. Speed limits are _pretty well signposted_, but the end of temporary speed limits aren’t, leading to some guess work being required. The presence of speed cameras is _very well signposted_, but the cameras themselves are _not painted yellow_ as they are elsewhere in Europe, so watch out.

Getting a driving license in Cyprus is _relatively easy_, which regrettably means **driving standards are pretty poor**. Unless there’s a speed camera, _speed limits are not strictly adhered to_ and there’s a relaxed attitude to the rules, particular on dual carriageways and when turning onto a road. A _defensive driving style is best adopted_ to avoid any accidents.

On the plus side, roads are _relatively quiet_ outside town centres and particularly outside of the Spring/Summer months when their are fewer tourists.

### Driving with GPS

We used Google Maps on our mobile phone to help us navigate North Cyprus’ road network. We found that, on the whole, **the directions we were given were accurate**, though there were some occasions where we were sent up steep, single track roads to nowhere. We _recommend scrutinising your route_ before you set off to ensure the same doesn’t happen to you.

![Getting to the harbour in Kyrenia is easy by public transport.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1744196793/north-cyprus-kyrenia-harbour_quyt4k.jpg)

## Public Transport

While we _recommend hiring a car_ if you can, getting to and from the main towns and cities of North Cyprus via public transport is **pretty easy**.

### Dolmus Buses

Privately-owned **Dolmus** mini buses (also known as _kombos_ buses) serve predetermined routes all over the territory. The buses come in all shapes and colours, but are mostly ageing white/cream Ford Transits. If you see one, you can **flag one down anywhere along the route** or at bus stops (in larger towns). You’ll see the origin and destination displayed in the windscreen. Whenever you wish the bus to stop along the route, simple _let the driver know_.

There are no timetables, but buses run _surprisingly frequently_, particularly near larger towns. Services **normally run up until 1900**, after which _services are either few and far between_ or _stop altogether_.

**Fares are cheap**, somewhere between 2-5 lira for local services, and up to around 10 lira for longer distances. Typically, you **pay the driver just before you alight** the bus at your destination. _Make sure you have plenty of change_.

On longer distance journeys, **you might find things run a little differently**. On a journey from Kyrenia/Girne to Nicosia/Lefkoşa, we found a makeshift ticket office set up alongside the row of buses at the bus station, where two friendly chaps were selling tickets and answering questions. Our tickets were checked by an inspector who boarded the bus from a layby, halfway to the capital.

Our best advice when using Dolmus buses in North Cyprus is to **go with the flow** and _don’t be afraid to ask questions_.

If you’re _not hiring a car_ during your visit, Nicosia/Lefkoşa is probably the best place to base yourself, as you can travel to _almost everywhere_ in the territory by Dolmus from the capital.

### Taxis

There are **plenty of taxi companies in North Cypru**s, particularly in and around larger towns. Depending on the firm, you can book a taxi by phone or online or you can get one at taxi stands or from their hubs. Fares are _pretty reasonable_ by European standards.

Sharing taxis is _very common_ in North Cyprus, with special taxi stands set up for this very purpose. It’s a good way of saving money. There’s no pressure to do so however, so don’t expect strangers to start piling into your cab halfway through the journey.

**Most taxis are metered**, but the meters are _not often used_, so **ask the driver how much the fare will be** before you get in. We had _partial success_ in negotiating fares, so ask whether the driver will consider lowering the fare by 10 lira or so. If they refuse, judge for yourself whether you think their offer is good value.

Most of our taxi drivers _were polite_, though driving standards weren’t great and it was a bit of a shock to see them answering their phones mid-journey. Doing so is _just as illegal_ as it is elsewhere in Europe, but everyone seems to do it anyway.

![Some attractions, like Agios Mamas Church, have tricky opening hours, so a mobile phone would be useful](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1744196770/north-cyprus-agios-mamas-church.jpg-2_izrjma.webp)

## Using a Mobile Phone in North Cyprus

Only two Turkish mobile networks operate in North Cyprus – [KKTC Telsim](https://www.kktctelsim.com/en/) (operated by Vodafone) & [KKTC Cell](https://www.kktcell.com/en) (operated by Turkcell).

You’ll find being able to access maps on your phone _pretty handy_ and we found, more than in other European destinations, that calling businesses and restaurants to check they were open was a necessity. We therefore **recommend getting a local sim card** for use during your visit.

During our visit, we purchased a _Tourist SIM_ from a KKTC Telsim store in Kyrenia/Girne for 50 lira. The sim included 50 international minutes, 500 SMS texts and a _huge_ 10GB of data for 7 consecutive days. Instructions to activate the SIM card were included and were as simple as texting a code to a number. The sim deactivates itself after the 7 day period.

Other pre-paid sims packages are available from the respective mobile network shops or from supermarkets.

EU residents _can not take advantage of free roaming_ in North Cyprus, so keep this in mind if you want to avoid unexpected charges. Network ranges do extend across the ‘_Green Line’_ in both directions, so you might be able to stay on a preferred network if you’re just popping across the border for a short time.

One way to ensure you don’t switch to a different network is by diving into your phone’s network settings, switching off ‘Automatic’ network selection and manually choosing a network instead. Both iOS and Android phones have this option.

## Turkish Coffee

Turkish Coffee is **very strong** and _unfiltered_ and therefore, not for the faint-hearted. If you do want to try it, make sure your _purse your lips_ to ensure you don’t drink the coffee grounds.

If you’re wanting to indulge in a local hot drink, **we recommend _Turkish Tea_** instead. We drank gallons of the stuff.

## Vegetarian and Vegan Food

Most restaurants we visited **offered vegetarian options**, though in some cases, the options were _rather limited_. The cuisine you’ll encounter is _strongly influenced by Turkish and Greek cuisine_ and thankfully, both of these contain lots of accidentally vegetarian options. If in doubt, _always ask_ which options are suitable for vegetarians. We found everyone we asked was keen to help.

Vegans will have **considerable difficulty** finding food to eat outside Nicosia/Lefkoşa. During our week-long visit, _only one restaurant_ we visited identified vegan options on their menu. With this in mind, you will want to consider self-catering during your visit.

![Examples of the type of signs you should take note of throughout North Cyprus.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1744196814/north-cyprus-varosha_qxmboe.jpg)

## Photography

The Turkish military have a **strong, visible presence** in North Cyprus. While you are _unlikely_ to see actual soldiers roaming about (except around the ‘Green Line’ in Nicosia/Lefkoşa), you will likely encounter military bases as you explore the territory. Photography of these bases is _not allowed_, so keep an eye out for red warning signs signalling you’re near a prohibited zone.

A _particularly prominent_ spot where **photography is prohibited** is the ghost town of [Varosha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varosha,_Famagusta). Before the arrival of Turkish forces in 1974, Varosha was a _thriving tourist seaside town_. Since then, the town has been left _abandoned_ and closed to the public. The town can be viewed from a small section of beach near the [Arkin Palm Beach Hotel](https://goo.gl/maps/QZuZFPGZCjF2) in Famagusta/Gazimağusa.

## Shopping

Due to the current political situation, North Cyprus is _subject to international embargos_. Other than Turkish brands, you won’t see recognisable shop or restaurant brands anywhere in the territory. If you do see a recognisable branded shop, it could be _counterfeit_, so be careful.

The lack of recognisable brands and the strong presence of independent businesses should be considered as a reason to visit North Cyprus. With so much of Europe’s shopping scene becoming increasingly identical, it was _refreshing and interesting_ to experience something so different.

### Opening Times

Opening times _vary considerably_ with different opening hours during the Summer and Winter seasons. Generally speaking, shops and businesses are open 08.30-18.00, with a 1-2 hour closure/siesta around midday during the Summer.

![A stray cat who greeted us one morning as we left our villa](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1744196782/north-cyprus-cat_f5lixb.jpg)

## Cats & Dogs in North Cyprus

Stray cats and dogs **can be found everywhere** in North Cyprus. Groups of dogs can be found lolling about in supermarket car parks & outside tourist attractions, whilst cats can _suddenly appear out of nowhere_, even inside restaurants and shops.

Almost all of the animals we saw _appeared to be in good health and condition_, with some having been visibly tagged to show they’d been checked over. **None of the animals showed us any aggression** and were instead universally _sweet-natured_. Locals appeared to have a high tolerance for the cats in particular, often holding doors open for them, petting them and feeding them.

Since the animals are free to roam and therefore not inoculated, it’s _probably not a good idea to pet them_ (though we found it pretty difficult to resist).

I hope you’ve found this post **informative** and **helpful**. We’ve tried our best to be both.

We hope you have an **incredible trip to North Cyprus**.
