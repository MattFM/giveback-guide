In this post, we’ll introduce some of our favourite vegan restaurants in Liverpool.

As frequent visitors to Liverpool, we’re always keen to try th latest vegan hotspots. Thankfully, there’s no shortage of vegan restaurants in Liverpool and there’s seemingly an endless stream of new ones being added to the roster.

This list (which we intend to keep updated) features mostly 100% vegan restaurants, but we’ve also included some takeaways and a couple of cafes/restaurants that also cater to meat-eaters. We’ve made sure to clearly identify each of these, in case you’re keen to avoid certain types of eatery.

## Our favourite vegan restaurants in Liverpool

Let’s now explore some of the best vegan restaurants in Liverpool. All of the restaurants we’ve featured in this list have been genuinely tried and tested by ourselves.

![The Vibe, one of the newest vegan restaurants in Liverpool](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1744901419/the-vibe-vegan-liverpool-1024x683.jpg_u8ld2b.webp)

### The Vibe

**Address:** Unit 1a, Chancery House, Paradise St, Liverpool L1 3HE  
[Visit Website](https://www.thevibecafe.co.uk)

The Vibe is a vibe! And everyone’s talking about it.

For good reason too! Inside, you’ll find exposed brickwork, leafy plants, wooden tabletops, muted colours and gold trims. The 100% vegan menu is varied, with a numerous breakfast options, toasties, bowls of veggie goodness and seasonal mains. Portions are generous and prices are very reasonable.

We visited during the festive period and enjoyed a Holiday Hash Stack, an Earth Bowl (a delicious bowl of dressed veggies that’s still on the menu) and finished with a Chocolate & Salted Caramel Cake with ice cream which was outstanding.

Thanks to its city centre location. it’s a busy spot. The space is pretty large though, so you shouldn’t have to wait too long for a table (if at all).

### The Caledonia

**Address:** 22 Caledonia St, Liverpool L7 7DX  
[Visit Website](http://www.thecaledonialiverpool.com)

The ‘Cali’ is a proper local boozer that, at first glance, is fairly indistinct from any other. Locals go in for a drink and a chat with other locals and they pass the time of day. Everything so far is yo might expect.

What gives the Cali the edge though is the 100% vegan menu. If you’re after a burger, some wings and some loaded fries, you’ll love it here. If you’ve still got some room left, there are even some desserts on offer. Dishes are served in plastic trays, reminiscent of school dinners.

As an added bonus, this is very much a dog-friendly pub. Water bowls are kept topped up, treats are available and there are even pictures of dogs all over the walls. Love it!

![Organico is certainly one of the prettiest vegan restaurants in Liverpool](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1744901473/organico-vegan-liverpool-1024x683.jpg_cqzcgk.webp)

### Organico Juice Bar & Eatery

**Address:** 74 Bold St, Liverpool L1 4HR  
[Visit Website](https://organicoliverpool.co.uk)

With its bold pink and leafy green decor, this place is an Instagrammer’s delight! Thankfully, this fairly new vegetarian/vegan eatery doesn’t suffer from style over substance. The food and drink is really top notch!

The plentiful vegan options are all very clearly labelled and really beautifully presented. We tried the French toast (which was amazing) and the vegan omelette (which was certainly unique and tasty). We couldn’t resist the delicious range of pastries in the window and ordered some to go.

So many great cafes and restaurants come and go quickly on Bold Street. We hope Organico is here to stay.

![The food and cocktails at Mowgli are so good – an essential visit](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1744901508/mowgli-vegan-liverpool-1024x683.jpg_pk0h99.webp)

### Mowgli Street Food

**Address:** 69 Bold St, Liverpool L1 4EZ  
[Visit Website](http://www.mowglistreetfood.com/)

Mowgli is neither a vegan, nor a vegetarian restaurant, but the vegan options on offer are so damn good, that we’re including it in our list.

Mowgli specialises in preparing Indian street market dishes, served quickly in traditional tins. For vegans, there are plenty of options to be found on a dedicated vegan menu. If you have trouble deciding, we heartily recommend the ‘Tiffin’, which they describe as ‘food roulette’. Effectively, the restaurant chooses a balanced quartet of dishes for you. Everything (and we really mean everything) on the menu is excellent, so you really can’t go wrong. We tend to share a tiffin between us and add on some extra bits (such as breads) once it comes out.

_Bookings are essential._

We’ve listed Mowgli’s original restaurant on Bold Street in this listing, but it’s worth noting they have second restaurant on Water Street. Both serve the same menu. Be on the lookout, as Mowgli is growing fast, with restaurants opening all over the country.

![Fluffy, crispy and delicious falafel at GoFalafel, Liverpool](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1744901348/gofalafel-vegan-liverpool-1024x683.jpg_j7ucxl.webp)

### Go Falafel

**Address:** 6 Richmond St, Liverpool L1 1EF  
[Visit Website](https://gofalafel.co.uk)

As vegans, we know that not all falafel is made equal. At worst, falafel is good, but there’s some falafel that knocks it out of the park. The falafel at GoFalafel does just this.

We ordered food from GoFalafel for delivery, so we don’t know about the restaurant itself (from the photos, it looks like there’s plenty of seating). The menu is really small and focused – just falafel, hummus, tabouleh, vine leaves and salad, with juices to wash it down. The small menu size means they can perfect their food, which they clearly are. The falafel is fresh, soft and warm with a crispy outside – spot on!

![The vegan combo for two at Bundobust, Liverpool is unbeatable](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1744901346/bundobust-vegan-liverpool-1024x683.jpg_zxyjhv.webp)

### Bundobust

**Address:** First Floor, 17-19 Bold St, Liverpool L1 4DN  
[Visit Website](https://bundobust.com)

This casual and contemporary vegetarian Indian street food eatery has rapidly become a firm favourite among locals. Much of the menu is vegan and labelled as such. Inside, the decor is modern and laid-back with an authentic Indian twist. The food, served in recyclable packaging, comes out quickly and offers a wonderfully unique take on traditional Indian favourites.

During our visit, we ordered the Vegan Combo for Two, a platter of dish different dishes. The Okra Fries were fabulous moreish but the Chloe Saag (chickpea curry) really stole of hearts – unbelievably tasty!

Make sure you leave room for a vegan chai once you’ve finished eating. Yummy!

![Our terribly-lit photos don’t do the food at Biff’s much justice](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1744901346/biffs-vegan-liverpool-1024x683.jpg_mwgpaq.webp)

### Biffs Vegan Burgers

**Address:** Manolis Yard, 8 Colquitt St, [Liverpool](https://www.happycow.net/europe/england/liverpool/), [England](https://www.happycow.net/europe/england/), L1 4DE _(deliveries only)_  
[Visit Website](https://biffs.co)

Biff has snuck into the list based purely on the tastiness of his burgers, wings and loaded fries. This isn’t a restaurant, so don’t go looking for it. Instead, you’ll need to order your food for delivery via [Deliveroo](https://deliveroo.co.uk/menu/liverpool/liverpool-city-centre/biffs-plant-based-burgers-and-wingz-liverpool).

We had a bit of trouble with our delivery – the driver said he was given the wrong address. Hopefully, you won’t have the same problem. The food (once it had arrived) was excellent though – full of great textures and flavours. That said, we’ll need a bit more convincing on eating the ‘wingz’ off of a bit of sugar cane, supposedly to replicate a bone. Not necessary in our opinion, and kinda gross.

![Bean There Coffee, Liverpool serves meat, but their vegan options are really good](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1744901345/bean-there-coffee-vegan-liverpool-1024x683.jpg_nttvkb.webp)

### Bean There Coffee

**Address:** 376 Smithdown Rd, Liverpool L15 5AN  
[Visit Website](https://www.beantherecoffeeshop.com)

A super cool and chill independent cafe that locals love. This place does serve meat, but the vegan options are really good. We can personally recommend both the vegan breakfast and the vegan hash. The menu is pretty small even when you count the non-vegan options, so don’t expect too much else to choose from. Service is efficient and friendly.

With family based in Liverpool, we visit the city a lot. That means we’ll be keeping this article up to date and we’ll be adding new vegan restaurants to the list.
