The travel brand formerly known as 'Here To Travel' is now 'Giveback'. All of our existing travel guides and resources are still here. The only difference is that now they're in a supporting role to our main focus, which is [the Giveback app](https://giveback.guide).

## What inspired the name change?

Over the past few years, we’ve become increasingly aware of a need to **change the way we travel**.

Our desire to make changes has been fuelled by a number of issues. We are all affected by climate change and the travel industry does have an impact on this global emergency. Within the tourism industry itself, issues such as overtourism, animal exploitation and social and cultural erosion are also on our minds.

In response to our growing concern over all these issues, we’ve not just wanted to reduce the negative impact of our travels, we’ve wanted to **positively contribute to the people and places we visit**.

In other words, we’ve wanted to **give back**.

On recent trips, we've tried to engage with social enterprises, environmental organisations, charitable tours, community cleanups and animal sanctuaries in our chosen destinations. Finding such projects was always a very _frustrating process_. We would often stumble upon projects that had long since been abandoned or we’d find something, only to struggle to find out how or if we could get involved.

Above all, there wasn’t one single repository to find such projects, especially one aimed solely at tourists.

That is, _until now_.

## What is Giveback?

[Give Back](https://giveback.guide/) is a growing database of animal sanctuaries, beach cleans, cultural exchanges, social impact projects, tours, tree planting, wellbeing experiences and so much more.

We built it to address all of the issues mentioned above. We’re still doing all the meticulous research we were doing for our own travels, but we’re now sharing the results of our research with travellers just like you.

Best of all, we’re sharing it for **free!**

Each listing **contains all the details you need** to get involved, including locations, URLs, photos and descriptions. Many of the projects are free to get involved with, with others requiring a donation of fixed fee (we’ve included this info too).

All of the listings are **run by passionate people** who want their projects to have a **positive impact on their communities** and their local ecosystems.

By engaging with the projects listed in the Give Back database on your future travels, you can **bring about positive change** to the people and places you visit.

Making a positive difference can be as easy as choosing to have a coffee at a social enterprise cafe (there are _lots already listed_ in the database). Whether you only have an hour or two or a day or two to spare, there’s plenty to get stuck into.

## We want you to be involved

We are really keen for Giveback to be a community project. As such, there are a number of ways for you to get involved.

- You can help us to grow our database by [submitting projects](https://giveback.guide/submit/) that you might be involved with, that you've engaged with or that you're simply aware of.

- You can also [follow us on Instagram](https://ww.instagram.com/giveback.guide), our primary social feed.
