Singapore is consistently named as one of the most expensive cities in the world.

For those considering a visit to Singapore, this may cause them to _think again_. With so many _comparitively inexpensive_ destinations surrounding Singapore, you wouldn’t blame them.

**Let’s not blow this out of proportion** however. Singapore is still a fantastic place to visit and many visitors will find that _things in Singapore are reasonably well priced_ or at least _similar_ to what they’re used to.

While Singapore’s main tourist attractions _will set you back a bit_, there are still some things to do in the world’s most expensive city that are **completely free!** With the help of some Singaporean friends, here is a list of some of the best free things to do in Singapore to help you **save money** during your visit.
