Hot off of [last month’s flurry of awesome platform updates](https://giveback.guide/blog/updates-in-july-2025/), we’re back to announce yet another big thing.

**Introducing… Giveback Guide Stays!**

Since the moment we started collecting projects in a database, we noticed that many of the same projects also offered accommodation in the form of guesthouses, homestays and B&Bs. 

We’re pretty organised and we decided early on to prioritise publishing projects, opting to keep Stays as something we’d launch later down the line.

Well, we’ve travelled down that line and we’ve now reached the Stays station. Poop poop! All aboard!


## What is Giveback Guide Stays

[Giveback Guide Stays](https://giveback.guide/stays) is a brand new section of our website, separate from [Projects](https://giveback.guide/projects), where we list places where you can stay for at least one night. Each Stay is run by a social enterprise, community project, animal sanctuary or conscious business with clear objectives to ensuring their business benefits people, places and the planet.

Stay pages are very similar to Project pages, containing just enough information to encourage you to click out and learn more. As well as linking to the official website for each Stay, we’re also linking to trusted booking platforms where you can compare rates (where available).

At launch, we only have a handful of Stays published. That’s because publishing Stays isn’t quite as straightforward as publishing Projects. So, think of our launch of the new Stays section as somewhat of a beta launch.

As usual, if you know of a Stay that you think would be a good fit for our database, please do [submit it for consideration](https://giveback.guide/submit).
