### Getting to St Albans by Train

Getting to St Albans by train is very popular. If you’re travelling from London, it’s easily the best way of getting to the city.

- St Albans Abbey station is the terminus for the Abbey Line which runs from Watford Junction. Follow the signs to the city centre which is a short walk uphill.

- St Albans City station is a large and busy station with frequent services to/from Bedford to the north, through to London and beyond to Brighton and other towns south of the capital.

Tickets can be purchased from ticket offices/vending machines right before travel, but you can sometimes save money by buying tickets in advance from Trainline.
