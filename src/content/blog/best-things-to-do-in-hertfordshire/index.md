Around 8 metres underneath a crossroads in the centre of Royston is an artificial cave whose origins are completely unknown. While there is no record at all as to why the cave exists, the most common theory is that it was used by the Knights Templar, a catholic military order founded in 1119.

The cave is very small, but captivating, with the walls of the cave almost entirely covered by etchings. Entry is by guided tour only and tickets can be purchased from 1.30pm on the day.
