Budapest is not often featured on bucket lists, but omitting it is a *mistake* in our opinion. The Hungarian capital is **full to bursting** with *stunning* architecture, unique attractions and great places to eat and drink. Prices are *generally cheaper* compared with other European capitals and flights in and out are also *great value*, making it a fantastic city break destination.

## Three Reasons to Visit Budapest

If you’re only in town for the weekend, here are three things you must do while you’re visiting.

### 1. Soak at a Thermal Bath House

Budapest sits on a geological fault and therefore benefits from geothermal activity. This energy is harnessed and used to warm the waters of beautiful bath houses across the city, the most famous of which is *Szechenyi* which is just to the north of the city centre.

### 2. Crawl the Ruin Pubs

The city suffered in World War 2, leaving a legacy of bombed out buildings. In more recent times, these buildings have been repurposed into *characterful pubs*, often sprawling across several floors. The larger ruin pubs cater to everyone from sociable drinkers to party animals. *Szimpla Kert* is a must visit before you discover your own favourites.

### 3. Play an Escape Room Game

Budapest has an unusual obsession with escape room games. There are allegedly *over 60 to choose from*, each offering a different theme and *cunning* chain of challenges to complete. Prepare for surprises, laughter and a *massive feeling of accomplishment* when you and your team emerge from your locked room within the time limit.

## Things to See & Do in Budapest

The Hungarian capital is packed full of great things to see and do. Here are our favourites.

The iconic outdoor pool at Szechenyi Thermal Baths, Budapest

### Szechenyi Thermal Baths

**Address:** *Állatkerti krt. 9-11* | **Metro:** *Széchenyi fürdő (Line M1)*

[Visit Website](http://www.szechenyibath.hu/)

Thanks to being located on a geological fault, Budapest has a network of thermal bath houses. *Szechenyi* is the **most famous** and the **most visited** for good reason. Depending on the time you go, there are at least *15 pools available*, some indoors, some outside, each boasting unique health benefits.

We recommend starting outside where you’ll find a *whirlpool* and *hot tubs*. Then, go indoors and dip into as many pools as you can. You’ll also discover *saunas* and *steam rooms*. Hungarians use thermal pools as a place to *relax and socialise*, so take your time, take it easy and get to know those around you. You’ll want to spend *at least 3-4 hours* here to get the most out of your visit.

- ***Tips:**** If there are two of you, we recommend paying extra for a cabin, where you can get changed and store your belongings. We strongly recommend taking flip flops, towels and robes, particularly if you visit in Winter.

### **Book** Fast Track Entry Tickets to *Szechenyi Thermal Baths*

It’s possible to avoid any queues at Szechenyi Thermals Baths by [buying your tickets online in advance](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=85974X1563631&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Fen-GB%2FBudapest-attractions%2FSzechenyi-Baths%2Fd499-a655).

### MindCrime Escape Room

**Address:** *Katona József utca 21* | **Metro:** *Nyugati pályaudvar (Line M3)*

[Visit Website](https://mindcrime.hu/en/escape-room)

Since the first one opened in 2011, Hungarians have really run with the concept of *escape rooms*. There are now estimated to be **at least 60** different games to choose from, each more *elaborate* and *fiendish* than the last.

We chose *MindCrime* as it was one of the few escape rooms that had a *discounted price for two players*. The game itself was cleverly arranged, *exciting*, surprising and had a great theme. We managed to complete the game with *55 seconds to spare* and felt a huge sense of accomplishment at the end. *We totally recommend it!*

- ***Don’t worry****! This escape room isn’t scary and doesn’t include live actors, so it’s great for all ages.

The haunting House of Terror is none of Budapest’s ‘must visit’ attractions

### House of Terror Museum

**Address:** *Andrássy út 60* | **Metro:** *Vörösmarty utca (Line M1)*

[Visit Website](http://www.terrorhaza.hu/en)

Hungary has been through a great deal of *pain and heartache* over the course of its history. Two particularly dark times – the Nazi occupation during World War 2 and the Soviet occupation thereafter – are documented in all its harrowing detail at the *House of Terror*.

The building in which the museum is housed was the setting for actual imprisonment, interrogations and executions during both of these bloody times, bringing particular poignancy to the impressive exhibits. The tour around the building culminates in a visit to the prison cells in the basement and a beautifully haunting memorial to those that suffered at the hands of brutal regimes.

- ***Pro-Tip:**** Help yourself to the multi-lingual information sheets in each room to find out more about the exhibits. The sheets are pretty wordy, so the audio guide might be worth investing in for a more immersive experience.

One of the world’s quirkiest attractions in the Children’s Railway in Budapest

### Gyermekvasút – Children’s Railway

**Address:** *Bátori László u.* | **Getting there:** Railway line 60

[Visit Website](https://www.gyermekvasut.hu/)

The *Children’s Railway* isn’t a railway made for children in the traditional sense. Children are certainly welcome to go for a ride of course. The difference lies in how the railway is run. Save for a few adults guiding the way, **the line is run entirely run by children**.

Sure enough, when we arrived at the practically deserted station, we were greeted by a lad of about 11 years who sold us our tickets. When the train arrived, we were helped aboard by more children while others checked our tickets and announced the stations. The sheer novelty combined with *beautiful passing scenery* made for an experience not to be missed.

- ***Look out:**** As the train passes the platforms and signal boxes, look out for the diligent salutes from the children.

## Nights Out in Budapest

Budapest is famous for its ruin pubs. Here are our two favourites.

### Szimpla Kert

**Address:** *Kazinczy u. 14* | **Metro:** *Kálvin tér (Lines M3/4)*

[Visit Website](http://www.szimpla.hu/)

Szimpla is Budapest’s **original ruin pub** and therefore an *essential* place to visit for a drink or two. The place is *huge* and full of nooks and crannies filled with bric-a-brac, art and graffiti. Szimpla attracts locals and visitors *of all ages*, therefore the atmosphere is *welcoming* and *not at all intimidating*.

There are *several* bars including one serving cocktails and there are lots of interesting places to hang out, including a *bath tub* and an old [Trabant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabant) with the roof removed. There’s also a counter serving hot traditional *Hungarian food*. A programme of *live music and events* are held regularly so check their website throughout your time in Budapest.

### Red Ruin

**Address:** *Irányi u. 25* | **Metro:** *Ferenciek tere (Line M3)*

[View on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/RedRuin/?fref=ts)

This ruin pub is *very small* and mostly frequented by students, but it’s worth a visit to see the **Russian communist-inspired decor** that adorns every inch of the walls. The drinks are *cheap* and the music tends to lean towards angsty nineties grunge and rock. Avoid the range of imported bottled beer and get a local brew on tap. Staff will be happy to recommend their favourites.

## Plan & Book Your Visit to Budapest

### Getting to Budapest

Thanks to it’s geographic position, Budapest is very easy and often inexpensive to get to. Most foreign visitors arrive by air and by train.

### Get to Budapest *by Air*

Budapest is served by *Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport* which is located 16km (9.9 miles) southeast of the city centre. A significant number airlines operate to and from the airport, offering both short and long-haul services to/from destinations all over the world.

### Get to Budapest *by Train*

Budapest is near to a number of other countries and it’s therefore common for tourists to arrive in Budapest by train.

Common train routes undertaken by visitors to Budapest include;

- [Bratislava to Budapest](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=85974X1563631&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetrainline.com%2Fen%2Ftrain-times%2Fbratislava-to-budapest) *(2h22m)*
- [Vienna to Budapest](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=85974X1563631&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetrainline.com%2Fen%2Ftrain-times%2Fvienna-to-budapest) *(2h38m)*
- [Prague to Budapest](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=85974X1563631&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetrainline.com%2Fen%2Ftrain-times%2Fprague-to-budapest) *(6h27m)*
- [Munich to Budapest](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=85974X1563631&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetrainline.com%2Fen%2Ftrain-times%2Fmunich-to-budapest) *(6h50m)*

### Getting from the airport

The airport is a *20 minute drive* away from the city centre. The most convenient way of getting to your accommodation is by taxi.

**Ignore the touts** in the arrivals hall and head outside, following the signs for ‘Taxis’. Here you’ll find a booth for *Fõ Taxi*. Tell the person inside the booth where you’d like to go. They’ll probably speak English, but it is recommended you have your destination written down just in case. You will be given a receipt with a predicted fare (normally between 6000-8000HUF, though your final fare will be determined by a meter) and the registration plate of your taxi. Wait a few moments and your cab will pull up in front of you. Your driver will probably want to see your receipt, so have it to hand.

### Getting Around Budapest

Budapest’s city centre is compact enough to traverse on foot.

When you want to save your energy or travel to attractions further afield, the city’s *efficient and inexpensive* bus, tram and metro network will get you to where you need to be. Tickets should be purchased from self-service machines **before boarding**. It is important you **validate your ticket** at metro entrances or on board buses and trams as tickets are routinely checked. Simply insert your ticket into the validation machine for a few moments.

As for taxis, the general advice, despite recent regulation, is still to call a reputable company and place a booking (even if you need to get somewhere immediately). Hailing a cab from the street may result in you getting *ripped off*. Companies deemed safe and trustworthy are [*Fõ Taxi*](http://fotaxi.hu/?lang=en) and [*City Taxi*](http://www.citytaxi.hu/index.php?lang=en). We can personally vouch for both of these firms.

### Places to Stay in Budapest

Accommodation is Budapest is generally a bit cheaper than it is in other European capital cities. With this in mind, it’s worthwhile searching for smarter, more luxurious accommodation to see if it’s cheaper than you think.

### Hotels in Budapest

We found an incredible deal on a room in the lavish [*Corinthia Budapest*](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=138444&awinmid=5986&clickref=budapest-guide&platform=dl&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.tripadvisor.co.uk%252FHotel_Review-g274887-d285437-Reviews-Corinthia_Budapest-Budapest_Central_Hungary.html%5D%5D), a hotel that would normally be considerably out of our price range.

### Practicalities & Local Customs

In the final section of our guide, we have collated all the extra bits of information you’ll need to know before you go.

### Currency

The currency of Hungary is the Hungarian Forint (shortened to HUF). Occasionally, you will find prices quoted or shown in Euros (€), but you will always be able to pay in HUF. For the best prices, pay in HUF as the conversion rate may not always be favourable.

### Tipping

It is customary to tip bar & restaurant staff, hotel porters and taxi drivers. Generally speaking, *10% of the total* is appreciated in all cases with higher percentages for exceptional service. For hotel porters, give 300-400 HUF.

It’s important to note, if you say ‘thank you’ when handing cash to restaurant staff, they will assume you don’t want change. If you do want change, hold your thanks until the transaction is complete. Tips should be handed directly to the individual rather than left on a table as the later method is considered rude.

### Language

The national language in Hungary is Hungarian, but Hungarians don’t expect visitors to be fluent. We found Budapest to be **very English-friendly**. Almost everyone we encountered spoke English well and most menus and notices (particularly on public transport) had English translations.

### Electricity

Sockets are predominantly rounded two-prong Type C (Euro), though very occasionally you’ll find Type F sockets in older buildings. The voltage is 230V at 50Hz.

### Cheers!

Thanks to an urban legend about Austrian generals allegedly clinking their beer glasses to celebrate the execution of the 13 Martyrs of Arad in 1849, Hungarians *don’t* clink their glasses together when toasting their drinks. While the unofficial ban expired in 1999, many still uphold the tradition. Visitors are *encouraged to do the same*.
