We, the co-founders of [Giveback Guide](https://giveback.guide), were recently delighted to guest on [That Travel’s](https://thattravel.co.uk) [Sustainable Travel Podcast](https://thattravel.co.uk/the-sustainable-travel-podcast/), hosted by Emma Cartwright.

On the episode, we talked in detail about Voluntourism, specifically its dark side. On the face of it, combining travel with volunteering appears like it could only be a positive thing. Indeed, in many cases, it is. But, there are plenty of pitfalls and things to consider for anyone seeking to embark in a bit of volunteering themselves.

One of our big talking points was working with children. Naturally, this is something everyone should be careful about in any scenario.

Often, safeguarding protocols, attachment issues and organisational affiliations are overlooked by both those offer voluntourism placements and those seeking to add value to their trips. All of these issues can have long term damaging effects on the children involved.

In the episode, we go into much more detail on this, including other issues in the voluntourism industry. It’s well worth a listen.
