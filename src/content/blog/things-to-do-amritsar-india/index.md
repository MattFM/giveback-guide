When it comes to finding things to do in Amritsar, India, your search needn’t take too long. That’s especially true if, like us, you’re only staying for two nights (an ideal length of time if you’re on a tight schedule).

Amritsar isn’t a large city and many visitors only really come to see one thing – the Golden Temple (see below). There are though a handful of other worthwhile things to see and do while you’re in Amritsar. In this mini travel guide, we’ve covered each of the options.

Everything you read in this guide is based on our own experiences from our visit to Amritsar. We write and research every word, without assistance from AI.

## Is it worth visiting Amritsar?

Yes, absolutely!

The Golden Temple is worth going to see on its own, but there’s also plenty more to see. The area surrounding the Golden Temple is really nice and has quite a unique atmosphere. If you’re already in the region, we heartily recommend catching a train here (there are plenty of fast train services from Delhi).

## Our list of things to do in Amritsar, India

We spent just two nights in Amritsar, which we felt was a sufficient length of time to see its two main sights, whilst also allowing time to relax and wander about in the city centre. Below is the list of things we did during our visit.

### Visit the Golden Temple by day and night

**Address:** Golden Temple Rd, Atta Mandi, Katra Ahluwalia, Amritsar, Amritsar Cantt., Punjab 143006

With its official name as _Harmandir Sahib Darbar Sahib_, the Golden Temple really is the signature thing to do in Amritsar and for many, the main reason to visit.

The temple has been rebuilt several times since its initial construction in 1589. The building today, built using marble and copper and covered in sparkling gold leaf was finished in 1809 and is truly astonishing to behold. I’ll always remember the overwhelming emotion I felt when I descended the steps and saw it for the first time. Photos simply don’t do it justice.

The temple compound has a very different feeling depending on the time of day you visit, so we recommend visiting twice, once by day and another time at night. You’ll likely notice a difference in visitor numbers, in the ambiance and, most obviously, the lighting.

Entry to the temple is free and everyone is welcome. Shoes must be removed and deposited for free at the shoe drop. Visitors must wash their hands and feet and everyone must cover their heads (you may provide your own covering, or you can buy one nearby before you enter). There are a number of others rules of entry which [this website](https://www.goldentempleamritsar.org/famous-temples-in-india/amritsar/golden-temple/things-to-remember.php#:~:text=Wash%20your%20feet%2Fhands%2C%20and,glasses%20and%20photography%20are%20prohibited.) does a good job of listing.

### Eat langar at the Golden Temple

Amritsar’s Golden Temple houses what is said to be the world’s largest free kitchen. Up to 100,000 people visit each day to enjoy a free vegetarian meal, cooked, served and managed by a huge number of volunteers.

As vegans, we tried our best to enquire whether there was anything we could eat. It’s super important to do this if you have any dietary requirements, as it’s very much frowned upon to leave any food uneaten. As the food is served, you may decline certain dishes, so feel free to do so. We were assured that the bread and the lentil dhal was okay for vegans, though we still can’t be 100% sure.

The entire process is really well managed, so just go with the flow and follow everyone else.

Langar at the Golden Temple is free for all, served 24 hours a day without prejudice. If you can afford to do so, donations are always welcome.

### Marvel at the Attari-Wagah border closure ceremony

The nightly closure ceremony at the India-Pakistan border is unmissable. There really is nothing else quite like it.

The border crossing is located near the Indian town of Attari, approximately one hour’s drive outside Amritsar. There are various ways of getting there, with most visitors opting to take an auto rickshaw (be it either shared or otherwise). Whilst exploring Amritsar, you’ll often be offered a ride by drivers. If you choose this option, be sure to barter as the opening offer will always be very high.

We chose to get there by a Hop On, Hop Off sightseeing bus, which cost us 315 INR each for a return journey. A ticket booth can be found on the Dharam Singh Market Chowk roundabout (which doubles as the pick-up and drop-off point). Prices are clearly displayed (no bartering required) and the service was punctual and reliable.

Once you arrive at the border, the process is very straightforward. Just follow the stream of other visitors and you’ll be guided towards the right place. If you’re in any doubt, just ask people for help. Foreign tourists seemingly get somewhat preferential treatment, with dedicated security lanes and seats right by the border gates, so keep flashing your passport to ensure you get to the good seats quickly.

Entry to the ceremony is free. You will need your passport. The start time of the ceremony varies, so ask around for the latest information. Your driver/transport provider will usually know the start time on a given day and will tell you where you should be and when.

### Pay respects at Jallianwala Bagh

**Address:** 1418, Gali Number 7, Ramanand Bagh, Katra Ahluwalia, Amritsar, Amritsar Cantt., Punjab 143001

Close to the Golden Temple is a garden which is now a memorial and museum. On 1 April 1919, British troops opened fire on thousands of peaceful protesters. People were shot dead even as they attempted to flee. The casual disregard for human life demonstrated by the British meant that record keeping was poor, so we don’t know for certain how many were killed – estimates vary from 379 to over 1,500.

Britain has never formally apologised for the massacre but expressed “deep regret” in 2019.

Today, visitors can pay their respects towards those that perished at an eternal flame. On the periphery of the gardens, there are some rooms housing exhibitions that tell the story of that day. Outside, there are walls still in tact that show bullet holes.

It’s a sobering experience that demonstrates the very, very worst facets of colonialism.
