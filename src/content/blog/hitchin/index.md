Hitchin, Hertfordshire is a small, market town of just over 30,000 residents, with records of its existence dating back around _1000 years_. The _historic_ town centre boasts pretty **cobbled streets** lined with a mixture of buildings from the _Tudor and Georgian_ periods, housing a surprisingly high number of independent cafes, restaurants and shops.

A small river, the River Hiz, flows lazily alongside _St Marys Church_, the _largest_ parish church in Hertfordshire, creating a _pretty and tranquil_ setting. In fact, much of Hitchin’s town centre is **calm & peaceful** and therefore a lovely place to window shop, people-watch and relax over an _artisan_ coffee.

Many tourists visit the area for nearby _Hitchin Lavender_ and often skip the town itself. This though is a mistake, for Hitchin has plenty to offer visitors who are looking to _complement their day out_ in the lavender fields with a bit of shopping and perhaps a bite to eat.

## The best things to do in Hitchin

While most visitors come for the Lavender, Hitchin has plenty of other attractions worth seeing.

### Hitchin Lavender

**Address:** _Arlesey Rd, Ickleford SG5 3UA_  
[View Website](https://www.hitchinlavender.com/)

People come from _all over the world_ to visit Hitchin Lavender, and rightly so. In peak flowering season (Jun-Aug), a **carpet of purple flowers bloom** in _breathtaking_ style over picturesque rolling fields. Admission includes use of a pair of scissors so that you can cut and keep as much Lavender as you can carry in your bag. The on-site cafe serves tea, cake and _good-quality_ lunches in a lovely rustic barn or outside in the garden.

_Plenty of free on-site parking. If you’re car-less, get a taxi._

### Hitchin Lido

**Address:** _Fishponds Rd, Hitchin SG5 1HA_  
[View Website](https://www.sll.co.uk/sandy/Hitchin_Swimming)

Hitchin Lido, part of the Swimming Centre, _opened in 1938_ and retains all of the character and style of that era. The _50 metre-long_ pool is heated and is **simply gorgeous** on a sunny day. Many visit just to lie in the sunshine and enjoy an ice cream whilst watching more athletic visitors swim lengths. Entry is a little on the steep side, but if you spend an hour or two here, _it’s worth it_. If it’s chilly, there’s also a 25m indoor pool open year round.

_Outdoor pool open May-Sept._

### St Mary’s Church

**Address:** _Churchyard, Hitchin SG5 1HP_  
[View Website](http://www.stmaryshitchin.co.uk/)

This 14th-15th century church sits in the heart of Hitchin town centre and is **Hertfordshire’s largest parish church**. The church is notable for how _spacious_ it is inside and, thanks to the window’s being unstained, how bright it is. It’s _particularly lovely_ on a sunny day! When you visit, look up to admire the _beautiful_ wooden ceiling and carvings.

At selected times of year, it’s possible to scale the clock tower for great views of the town. Check out the website for more information on this.

_Admission is free, though a donation would be gratefully accepted._

### North Hertfordshire Museum

**Address:** _Brand Street, Hitchin SG5 1JE_  
[View Website](https://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/museums/north-hertfordshire-museum)

North Hertfordshire Museum’s very existence has been tumultuous. Thankfully, after years of delays and land disputes, the museum is now fully open. On the ground floor, a small gallery of historic artefacts tells the history of the district, whilst an adjacent gallery houses visiting collections on a variety of themes and topics. On the first floor, two more galleries bring the county’s local history to life. There’s now also a cafe serving drinks and light lunches.

_Admission is free._

### The Victoria (The Vic)

[View Website](http://www.thevictoriahitchin.com/)

## Plan & Book your visit to Hitchin

In this section, we’ll go through how you can plan and book your visit to Hitchin.

### Trains to Hitchin

_Hitchin station_ is served by trains operated by **Great Northern** and **Thameslink** between _London and Peterborough/Cambridge_. Trains to Hitchin depart from both _St Pancras International_ and _London Kings Cross_.

For spur of the moment visits from London, we recommend visiting Kings Cross primarily, as departures from both Kings Cross and St Pancras International are displayed on the departure boards. Tickets can be purchased right before you travel from ticket offices or self-service machines.

Once you’ve arrived in Hitchin, the town centre is a _15 minute walk_ from the station. Metered taxis are normally waiting outside the station if you’d rather get a lift.

### Buses to Hitchin

Hitchin is served by a variety of buses and long distance coaches. National Express runs **coach 777** from _Stansted Airport to Birmingham_ and **coach 787** from _Heathrow Airport (T5) to Cambridge_ calling at Hitchin town centre.

More locally, Stagecoach run **bus 9a & 9b** to/from _Bedford_ and Arriva runs **Sapphire 100 & 101** buses between _Stevenage and Luton/Luton Airport_.

### Getting to Hitchin by road

Hitchin lies a few miles west of junction 8 of the A1(M).

There are plenty of pay & display car parks in Hitchin with cheaper rates after 3pm and free parking on Sundays. You should check for free parking along Hollow Lane (one side of the road is restricted to a maximum of two hours, the other side is unrestricted), though it’s a popular option for locals. Otherwise, we recommend Woodside Car Park (card or mobile payments only) on _Walsworth Road_ as it’s pretty good value and not far from the centre.

### Getting around Hitchin

Hitchin is a small town and can be easily traversed on foot.

Wheelchair users and those with limited mobility may have a little difficulty on the cobbled streets of the historic centre and in traversing the steps alongside the river near St Mary’s Square car park. There is a ramp from the market area to the car park behind the public toilets but it’s not signposted.

For attractions outside the town centre (like Hitchin Lavender), we recommend calling local cab company, [Tiny’s](http://www.tinystaxis.co.uk/) on 01462 888 888. Uber also operate a limited service in the area.
