We always working hard to make Giveback Guide the very best it can be. In July 2025, we surprised even ourselves by how much we were able to work on.

Here are all the major updates and improvements we deployed to the website.

## A brand new search experience

When we first relaunched our website, the search experience was not great. We were using the default setup of an off-the-shelf solution.

Since search is such an important part of the Giveback Guide experience, we sought to improve it as a matter of urgency. I’m delighted to say, search is now significantly better and we didn’t even have to change the backend search engine that we started with.

The new search experience brings with it multiple benefits;

- **Filters:** You can now filter your search results by projects, stays and blog posts. We’ll likely add more filters in the future to really find tune your results.
- **Super fast:** We’re still using the same search technology we started with. We’ve just customised it to our specific needs.
- **Fuzzy search:** The search engine now produces better results, because we’ve fined tuned the search index to recognise potential misspellings (otherwise known as fuzzy search).
- **Nicer design:** The design of the search results now matches the rest of our website.

## Image optimisation across the site

Another big update to the platform this month came in the form of improvements to how images are shown on the site.

Before this update, we used images with large dimensions and file sizes. Often, the dimensions of the images far exceeded the actual dimensions of the image on your screen. This lead to slower page loading speeds for the user and therefore, greater amounts of carbon being produced.

Now, optimised images with dimensions appropriate to the actual size of the image on your screen are loaded. The result of this is much faster page loading speeds and much less carbon being generated.

We’re delighted that the changes we’ve implemented are at the cutting edge of web image standards.

## Redesigned pages on tablets & desktops

Most of our users are visiting us on mobile devices, so we design our pages primarily for those users. There is though still a fairly sizeable number of users using tablets and desktops, so we spent some time improving the experience for you guys too.

Now, all our blog posts and project pages share a much nicer 2-column layout.

## We’ve added Google Maps links

While we’re not massive fans of how Google does business, it’s undeniable that Google Maps is still the best online mapping tool and that it’s used by millions all over the world.

After polling [our Instagram followers](https://www.instagram.com/giveback.guide), we decided to start adding links to the relevant Google Maps listings for all applicable projects and stays in our database. 

This will enable you to start saving projects to your own Google accounts however you wish.
