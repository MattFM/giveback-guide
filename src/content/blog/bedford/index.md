Ask a Bedfordian whether there are plenty of things to do in Bedford and you probably won’t get a favourable reply. Bedfordians can be surprisingly downbeat about their town.

Ask this particular (former) Bedfordian though, and he’ll write an entire travel guide. And, here it is!

Bedford is a small, **unassuming market town** of around _80,000 people_. In proportion to its size, it is one of the **most culturally diverse towns in the UK** with nearly _10%_ of the population originating from South Asia and _almost 30%_ of Italian descent (me included).

The **cultural patchwork** is reflected in the town’s **extensive offering of restaurants** serving _high quality_ and _reasonable priced_ cuisine from _all over the world_. As well as ubiquitous _Italian_ and _Indian/Bangladeshi_ restaurants, there are eateries serving _French, Japanese, Mexican_ and _Turkish_ food, to name but a few.

In this post, I’ll be uncovering some of the best things to do in Bedford, aimed at both residents and visitors. If you’re looking to spend some quality time in town, this post is for you.

## Is Bedford worth visiting?

Yes, Bedford is definitely worth visiting.

It’s cliche, but Bedford really does offer **something for everyone**, not just in terms of food but in _attractions and activities_. **Fabulous museums**, well-tended parks, a **stunning riverside area**, multiple sporting facilities, a _burgeoning arts scene_ and _cute independent shops_ all help to ensure everyone’s needs are catered for.

With minimal planning, a day out in Bedford would be very well spent. To get the most out of a visit, _a stay of at least one night is recommended_.

## Best things to do in Bedford

Bedford offers plenty of interesting and unique attractions. Here are some of our favourites.

![The Panacea Museum has a beautiful and peaceful garden around the back](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1744196240/bedford-england-panacea-museum-garden-1024x683-1_fzdg3d.jpg)

### Visit the Panacea Museum

**Address:** _9 Newnham Road, Bedford MK40 3NX_

Discover the _amazing and peculiar_ story of the Panacea Society, a religious community formed in the early twentieth century that created its own _Garden of Eden_ in the centre of Bedford. We found it **fascinating**! Once you’ve explored the well-presented displays at the [Panacea Museum](http://panaceamuseum.org/), visit the lovely & peaceful cafe and garden at the back of the property. _Worth visiting Bedford for this alone!_

Admission is **free!**

****Check ahead:**** The museum has changeable opening hours, so check [their website](http://panaceamuseum.org/) before you visit.

![Bedford’s main museum is The Higgins, containing a number of permanent exhibits](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1744900520/bedford-england-higgins-museum-1024x683.jpg_twdr0q.webp)

### Drop into The Higgins

**Address:** _Castle Ln, Bedford MK40 3XD_

Bedford’s **recently refurbished** [Higgins Museum](http://www.thehigginsbedford.org.uk/) and art gallery charts the _history of Bedford_ from the stone age to the modern day in a _fabulously contemporary_ style. As well as fossils, pottery, furnishings and costumes, there are _priceless works of art_ by Picasso, Turner and Constable. There are frequent visiting exhibitions and events and there’s an adjoining cafe/restaurant.

Admission is **free!**

### Stroll along The Embankment

**Address:** _The Embankment, Bedford MK40 3PD_

By far the best part of Bedford is its [riverside area](https://www.bedford.gov.uk/leisure_and_culture/parks_and_open_spaces/the_embankment_and_mill_meadow.aspx), colloquially known as The Embankment. Finely manicured flower beds, huge leafy trees, wide green meadows & parks, plenty of wildfowl and thoughtfully placed paths and bridges combine to create a beautiful & relaxing parkland.

If you’re travelling by car, there’s plenty of paid parking along The Embankment and along adjacent streets and free parking along Shaftesbury Ave (though you’ll be lucky if you grab a spot). Parking on Sundays is free pretty much everywhere.

****Enhance your visit:**** __Boat & bike hire__ is available at the recently revamped cafe, __The Longholme__ and there’s a putting green in __Russell Park__ (both spring/summer only). 

![Priory Country Park is a lovely green space near the centre of Bedford](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1744900526/bedford-england-priory-country-park-1024x683.jpg_g3q7mc.webp)

### Catch a breather at Priory Country Park

**Address:** _Barkers Ln, Bedford MK41 9DJ_

A peaceful and well-maintained 145 hectare green space consisting of lakes, meadows and woodland. [Priory Country Park](http://www.priorycountrypark.co.uk/) is where locals head to for a breather. A brisk walk around the lake takes around an hour, leaving time to visit the nearby Beefeater pub or the newly opened cafe in the visitor centre. Check the website for information on guided walks by experienced park rangers. Access is best by car and there’s plenty of free on-site parking.

![Bedford’s surrounding waterways are lovely and best seen by boat](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1744900504/bedford-england-river-1024x683.jpg_xkgfiq.webp)

### John Bunyan Boat Cruises

**Departure point:** _Sovereigns Quay, Bedford MK40 1QS_

The [John Bunyan Community boat](https://www.johnbunyanboat.org/) offers regular weekly cruises along the River Great Ouse from Bedford town centre to Priory Marina and Kempston. The volunteer-run community projects also offers a series of special themed cruises including ‘Jazz Night’ cruises.

We really enjoyed our leisurely cruise along the river, taking full advantage of their cream tea add-on to make the afternoon a little bit extra special.

Pre-booking is essential.

![Canoe Trail offers a variety of ways to get onto Bedford’s waterways](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1744900509/bedford-england-canoes-1024x683.jpg_h3hmty.webp)

### Hire canoes, kayaks and SUPs with Canoe Trail

**Meeting point:** _alongside Longholme Boathouse, The Embankment, Bedford MK40 3TP_

If you prefer to do things a little more hands-on, [Canoe Trail](https://www.canoetrail.co.uk/) offer anyone the chance to hire their water-based vessels. You can choose from a range of canoes, kayak and SUPs or varying sizes with all the safety equipment and briefings included as standard.

We had never captained a two-person canoe before, but the friendly team at Canoe Trail gave us lots of confidence and we almost literally took to it like a duck to water. During our two hour paddle, we were free to go wherever we liked, but we were encouraged to follow the provided map which took us down river towards nearby Cardington Lock. It was a wonderfully mindful way to enjoy the river.

## Plan & Book your visit to Bedford

In this section, we’ll go through how you can plan and book your visit to Bedford.

### Getting to Bedford by Train

Bedford has two railway stations, but you should avoid _Bedford St. Johns_ and alight at _Bedford_ (which is occasionally referred to as _Bedford Midland_).

- **Thameslink** trains run frequently from _Brighton_ and _London St Pancras International,_ via both _Luton Airport_ & _Gatwick Airport_ which terminate at Bedford.

- Faster **East Midlands Railway** services (occasionally branded _Luton Airport Express_) also run from _London St Pancras International_ and continue to _Sheffield, Nottingham & Derby._

- A regional route from _Bletchley_ (near _Milton Keynes_) is serviced by **London Northwestern Railway**.

Upon arrival at _Bedford_, the 5-10 minute walk into the town centre is clearly signposted (follow town centre and/or bus station). Alternatively, council-operated taxis are always waiting outside, though fares are expensive.

Tickets can be purchased right up until the moment of departure, though savings can be made by booking _Advance_ tickets ahead of time. To do so, [we recommend booking tickets with Trainline](https://go.skimresources.com?id=85974X1563631&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetrainline.com%2Fdestinations%2Ftrains-to-bedford).

### Getting to Bedford by Bus

If you’re travelling within Bedford borough or just across the border, Stagecoach and Grant Palmer provide reliable services. Stagecoach runs the reliable and frequent X5 bus service, starting in Oxford and calling at Bicester, Buckingham, Milton Keynes and terminating in Bedford. From the east, bus 905 services a route from Cambridge via St. Neots to Bedford every 30 minutes.

### Getting to Bedford by Road

Bedford sits between the M1 and A1(M) via the A421. All of the town centre car parks are run by the borough council. All are _free_ for the first two hours on Saturdays and _free all day_ on Sundays. 

### Getting Around Bedford

Bedford is easy to navigate on foot. Almost all of the listings on this page are within walking distance of one another.
