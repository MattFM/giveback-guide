On a recent 48 hour trip, we quickly discovered that Glasgow has a fantastic vegan food scene. With over 15 fully plant-based eateries in the city centre (most of which being independent businesses) and many, many more that are vegan-friendly, there’s plenty for vegans to get stuck into.

There are in fact so many vegan cafes, bars and restaurants in Glasgow, that during our visit, we were able to dine exclusively at 100% vegan establishments. That never happens!

In this post, we bring you a list of our favourite 100% vegan cafes, restaurants and bars in Glasgow to help you choose where to go on your next visit to Scotland’s largest city.

## Our Favourite Vegan Restaurant in Glasgow

We were only in Glasgow for 48 hours, so we only have one vegan restaurant listed below. That said, the pubs and bars featured further down in this post are also essentially restaurants where you can enjoy an evening meal.

Since we only have one restaurant in our guide, we had better make sure it’s a good one. Thankfully, it very much is.

### Suissi Vegan Kitchen: Incredible Vegan Malaysian Dishes

**Address:** 494 Dumbarton Rd, Partick, Glasgow G11 6SL

Consistently voted the best vegan restaurant in Glasgow, [Suissi Vegan Kitchen](https://www.suissivegankitchen.co.uk) is just as incredible as the reviews make them out to be.

With a reputation for authenticity and high quality, [booking at Suissi](https://www.suissivegankitchen.co.uk/#GoHgUD) is essential to ensure you don’t miss out eating here. And that would be a tremendous shame.

Malaysian-born Mama Lim is the founder of Suissi and she’s created an irresistible menu of pan-Asian-inspired delicacies. We can highly recommend the Lion’s Mane mushroom Rendang and the Curry Laksa Ramen. Both we packed with flavour and a perfect level of spiciness.

## Our Favourite Vegan Bakeries in Glasgow

Glasgow isn’t the first place many would think of when it comes to delicate, crisp, buttery pastries. Whilst Paris almost certainly takes the crown for incredible vegan baked treats, allow us to throw a spanner in the works.

That spanner is named ‘Glasgow’.

![Vegans rarely have a choice like this one at TheDorkyFrench Vegan Bakery in Glasgow](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1745839177/thedorkyfrench-vegan-bakery-1024x683.jpg_e808wr.webp)

### TheDorkyFrench Vegan Bakery

**Address:** 39 Parnie St, Glasgow G1 5RJ

Opened as recently at June 2023, [TheDorkyFrench Vegan Bakery](https://www.thedorkyfrench.com) has already made quite a name for itself, even with non-vegans.

French-born proprietor, Marlène, vowed to bring a taste of her home country to the people of Glasgow, ensuring a commitment to sustainability for good measure. Today, TheDorkyFrench’s ‘artisan viennoiseries’ are freshly made daily using French flour and premium ingredients and are rightfully incredibly popular.

We ordered a Creme Brûlée Danish and Supreme Roll (with raspberry jam and chocolate peanut butter) and we can confidently say they were among the very best pastries we’ve ever sampled. Crisp and flakey on the outside, soft on the inside with a delicate and buttery flavour. _Incroyable!_

While there are a couple of benches to sit on, expect to take away only. Prices are a little bit on the high side, but still great value and well worth it. Plan to visit as early as possible or [pre-order on their website](https://www.thedorkyfrench.com) to avoid disappointment.

### Honeytrap Bakery

**Address:** 4 Skirving St, Shawlands, Glasgow G41 3AA

100% plant-based [Honeytrap Bakery](https://www.honeytrapbakery.com) answers the question, “Is there room for more than one vegan bakery selling exquisite baked treats in Glasgow?”

The answer is unequivocally, yes!

Located in Shawlands, a suburb south of the city centre, Honeytrap has a large range of both sweet and savoury bakes, all made with organic ingredients and with a great deal of love and care.

In order to avoid disappointment, we [pre-ordered our bakes via the website](https://www.honeytrapbakery.com), which we would recommend doing. On their website it states that the bakery will close early should they sell-out. Fair warning!

Our savoury selections were a Macaroni pie (super moorish) and a Basil and vegan ricotta parcel with sundried tomatoes (juicy and crispy). Our sweets were a Raspberry and Chocolate Semlor bun (light, fluffy and delicious) and a Passion Fruit Dome (gorgeous flavour and texture). Everything was out of this world.

Honeytrap is well worth heading to Shawlands for. There are plenty of cool cafes, restaurants and shops nearby too. If you’ve got a car, parking in the area is a bit of a nightmare, but we eventually managed to find somewhere on a neighbouring street. If you’re without a car, take a Scotrail train to Crossmyloof station and the bakery is then 10 minutes walk from there.

## Our Favourite Vegan Pubs/Bars in Glasgow

There are literally hundreds of pubs in Glasgow and it’s heartening that a handful of them are fully vegan. Not content with simply ensuring the drinks are cruelty-free, the two vegan pubs we’ve listed below also provide some great food options.

![The cosy interior of vegan pub, The 78 in central Glasgow](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxl7wsnx/image/upload/v1744196922/the-78-interior_mtzh7h.jpg)

### The 78

**Address:** 10-14 Kelvinhaugh St, Finnieston, Glasgow G3 8NU

If you’re after a welcoming, cosy and laid-back pub to while away the hours, [The 78](https://www.the78.co.uk/) is a really great choice.

The 78 does the basics brilliantly. A large selection of animal-free cask, draught and bottled beers (with a choice of guest beers), a friendly team and a comfortable vibe. Lovely stuff!

On top of that, there’s a weekly quiz night, DJs at the weekends and occasional live music gigs.

The icing on the cake (the vegan cake) is that the kitchen hosts pop-ups operated by a circulating rota of local, vegan food outlets. During our visit, the menus offered a selection of tasty Mexican street food. To accompany of beers, we tried some scrumptious smashed potatoes. Purely for research purposes, obvs!

### Mono

**Address:** 12, Kings Court, King St, Glasgow G1 5RB

Bar, restaurant, music venue, exhibition space and record shop all in one, [Mono](https://www.monocafebar.com) oozes a sense of coolness and a palpable dedication to the arts and veganism.

The large dining area is split into two, with table service provided on the left and bar service on the right. The menu is also sizeable, offering small plates, sourdough pizzas, chip shop favourites and pub classics (all of which are 100% plant-based).

We couldn’t resist trying their To-fish and Chips (with mushy peas on the side) and a Cubano pizza (Pulled BBQ jackfruit, smoked cheese, dill pickle and a Carolina mustard drizzle), both of which were tasty and satisfying.

Do [check their website](https://www.monocafebar.com/events) ahead of your website to see if there are any events on.
