# Color Rollout Checklist

> **Goal:** Introduce new colors gradually to establish clear visual hierarchy without overwhelming users.

## Progress Tracking

- [ ] Phase 1: Primary Accent (Week 1)
- [ ] Phase 2: Secondary Buttons (Week 2)
- [ ] Phase 3: Impact Badges (Week 3)
- [ ] Phase 4: Hover States & Polish (Week 4+)

---

## Phase 1: Primary Accent Color
**Timeline:** Week 1  
**Color:** Emerald Green `#059669`  
**Goal:** Establish primary action color across all main CTAs

### Tasks

#### 1.1 Header CTA
- [ ] Update `src/components/layout/Header.astro`
- [ ] Change Join/Dashboard button to use accent color
- [ ] Test on light and dark mode
- [ ] Verify accessibility (contrast ratio)

**Files to update:**
```
src/components/layout/Header.astro
```

#### 1.2 Homepage Primary CTA
- [ ] Update `src/pages/index.astro`
- [ ] Replace inline "Join our community" button
- [ ] Use Button component with `variant="primary"`
- [ ] Check responsive sizing

**Files to update:**
```
src/pages/index.astro
```

#### 1.3 Project Pages
- [ ] Update `src/pages/projects/[...slug].astro`
- [ ] "Visit Website" button → primary variant
- [ ] Ensure it's the most prominent action
- [ ] Test with real project data

**Files to update:**
```
src/pages/projects/[...slug].astro
src/components/content/ProjectCard.astro (if buttons on cards)
```

#### 1.4 Stay Pages
- [ ] Update `src/pages/stays/[...slug].astro`
- [ ] "Visit Website" or "Book Now" → primary variant
- [ ] Match project page hierarchy
- [ ] Test with real stay data

**Files to update:**
```
src/pages/stays/[...slug].astro
src/components/content/StayCard.astro (if buttons on cards)
```

#### 1.5 Form Submit Buttons
- [ ] Contact form
- [ ] Join form
- [ ] Any other forms
- [ ] Ensure all use primary variant

**Files to update:**
```
src/pages/contact.astro
src/pages/join/*
```

### Phase 1 Review Checkpoint

**Before moving to Phase 2:**
- [ ] Live with changes for 3-5 days
- [ ] Get feedback from 2-3 users
- [ ] Check analytics (did CTR improve?)
- [ ] Take screenshots for comparison
- [ ] Verify no accessibility issues
- [ ] Confirm color feels right (adjust shade if needed)

**Questions to ask:**
- Does the hierarchy feel clear?
- Is it obvious what the primary action is on each page?
- Does the color align with the brand mission?
- Any pages feel imbalanced?

---

## Phase 2: Secondary Buttons
**Timeline:** Week 2  
**Color:** White with green border  
**Goal:** Differentiate supporting actions from primary CTAs

### Tasks

#### 2.1 Save Buttons
- [ ] Add to project pages
- [ ] Add to stay pages
- [ ] Use `variant="secondary"` or `variant="outline"`
- [ ] Should be less prominent than "Visit Website"

**Files to update:**
```
src/pages/projects/[...slug].astro
src/pages/stays/[...slug].astro
```

#### 2.2 Card Actions
- [ ] "Learn More" buttons on cards
- [ ] Use secondary variant
- [ ] Ensure they don't compete with card images

**Files to update:**
```
src/components/content/ProjectCard.astro
src/components/content/StayCard.astro
src/components/content/PostCard.astro
```

#### 2.3 Supporting Actions
- [ ] "Share" buttons
- [ ] "Back" buttons
- [ ] Any other non-primary actions

### Phase 2 Review Checkpoint

**Before moving to Phase 3:**
- [ ] Primary vs. secondary hierarchy clear?
- [ ] No confusion about which action is most important?
- [ ] Live with it for a few days
- [ ] Take screenshots

---

## Phase 3: Impact Category Badges
**Timeline:** Week 3  
**Goal:** Add visual personality to impact areas

### 3.1 Environmental Badges (Same as Accent)
- [ ] Use `#059669` (same as primary accent)
- [ ] Add to project cards
- [ ] Add to stay cards
- [ ] Add to detail pages

**Color:** `#059669` (Emerald Green)

**Files to update:**
```
src/components/content/ProjectCard.astro
src/components/content/StayCard.astro
src/pages/projects/[...slug].astro
src/pages/stays/[...slug].astro
```

### 3.2 Social Impact Badges (Introduce Second Color)
- [ ] Use `#DC6B4A` (Terracotta)
- [ ] Only where environmental doesn't apply
- [ ] Keep badges small (text-xs)
- [ ] Test against various backgrounds

**Color:** `#DC6B4A` (Terracotta)

**Review before continuing:**
- [ ] Does adding a second color help or hurt?
- [ ] Are badges too prominent?
- [ ] Should they be more subtle?

### 3.3 Cultural/Wellbeing Badges (Third Color - Optional)
- [ ] Use `#7C3AED` (Purple)
- [ ] Complete the three-category system
- [ ] Monitor if it feels like too much

**Color:** `#7C3AED` (Purple)

**Decision point:**
- [ ] Do we need all 3 colors or is 1-2 enough?
- [ ] Could we use tints/shades of one color instead?

### Phase 3 Review Checkpoint

**Before moving to Phase 4:**
- [ ] Page feels cohesive, not chaotic?
- [ ] Badges enhance but don't distract?
- [ ] Consider removing a color if too busy
- [ ] Live with it for at least a week

---

## Phase 4: Hover States & Polish
**Timeline:** Week 4+  
**Goal:** Refine interactions and add polish

### 4.1 Navigation Links
- [ ] Hover states use accent color
- [ ] Header navigation
- [ ] Footer links
- [ ] Breadcrumbs

**Files to update:**
```
src/components/layout/Header.astro
src/components/layout/Footer.astro
src/components/layout/HeaderLink.astro
```

### 4.2 Body Content Links
- [ ] Underline or color on hover
- [ ] Ensure they're clearly interactive
- [ ] Don't overpower the content

**Files to update:**
```
src/styles/global.css
```

### 4.3 Focus States
- [ ] Form inputs
- [ ] Buttons (already handled by Button component)
- [ ] Interactive elements
- [ ] Ensure keyboard navigation is clear

### 4.4 Success/Error States (If Needed)
- [ ] Form validation
- [ ] Success messages
- [ ] Error messages
- [ ] Keep separate from brand colors

---

## Alternative: Micro-Rollout

If you want to be extra cautious, use this super-gradual approach:

### Micro Phase 1a (Day 1)
- [ ] Header button ONLY
- [ ] Get comfortable with the color

### Micro Phase 1b (Day 2-3)
- [ ] Add homepage CTA
- [ ] See how they work together

### Micro Phase 1c (Day 4-7)
- [ ] Add all other primary CTAs
- [ ] Complete Phase 1

---

## Red Flags - Stop & Reassess If:

- ❌ Page feels chaotic or overwhelming
- ❌ Users confused about where to click
- ❌ Multiple things competing for attention
- ❌ Adding color "just because"
- ❌ Can't explain what problem the color solves
- ❌ Analytics show decreased engagement

## Good Signs - Keep Going:

- ✅ Clear visual hierarchy
- ✅ Eye naturally drawn to primary actions
- ✅ Page feels cohesive
- ✅ Color serves a purpose
- ✅ Users find what they need faster
- ✅ Positive feedback

---

## Testing Checklist (Between Each Phase)

### Visual Testing
- [ ] Test on multiple screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] Check light mode
- [ ] Check dark mode
- [ ] Test with different browsers
- [ ] Take before/after screenshots

### Accessibility Testing
- [ ] Run contrast checker on all color combinations
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation
- [ ] Test with screen reader
- [ ] Ensure focus states are visible

### User Testing
- [ ] Get feedback from 2-3 users
- [ ] Ask: "What action would you take on this page?"
- [ ] Ask: "Does anything feel confusing or overwhelming?"
- [ ] Observe where their eyes go first

### Analytics
- [ ] Compare CTR on primary buttons (before/after)
- [ ] Check bounce rates
- [ ] Monitor time on page
- [ ] Track conversion metrics

---

## Key Questions Before Each Phase

1. **What problem does this color solve?**
   - Does it create hierarchy?
   - Does it encourage action?
   - Does it make the user's job easier?

2. **Can I explain the purpose to someone else?**
   - If not, don't add the color yet

3. **Does this align with the brand mission?**
   - Giveback = sustainability, growth, positive impact
   - Does the color support that?

---

## Tailwind Config Updates

### Phase 1 (Add accent color):
```js
// tailwind.config.cjs
colors: {
  accent: {
    DEFAULT: '#059669',
    hover: '#047857',
    light: '#D1FAE5',
  }
}
```

### Phase 3 (Add impact colors):
```js
// tailwind.config.cjs
colors: {
  accent: {
    DEFAULT: '#059669',
    hover: '#047857',
    light: '#D1FAE5',
  },
  impact: {
    environmental: '#059669',
    social: '#DC6B4A',      // Add in Phase 3.2
    cultural: '#7C3AED',    // Add in Phase 3.3
  }
}
```

---

## Button Component Updates

### Update existing Button component:

**File:** `src/components/ui/Button.astro`

```diff
const variants = {
-  primary: 'bg-black text-white hover:bg-gray-900 focus:ring-gray-500',
+  primary: 'bg-emerald-600 text-white hover:bg-emerald-700 focus:ring-emerald-100',
-  outline: 'border-1 border-black text-black hover:bg-gray-100 focus:ring-gray-500',
+  outline: 'border-2 border-emerald-600 text-emerald-600 hover:bg-emerald-600 hover:text-white focus:ring-emerald-100',
};
```

Or use Tailwind classes directly:
```astro
primary: 'bg-accent text-white hover:bg-accent-hover focus:ring-accent-light',
outline: 'border-2 border-accent text-accent hover:bg-accent hover:text-white focus:ring-accent-light',
```

---

## Files Reference

### Core Files to Update in Phase 1:
```
src/components/ui/Button.astro (update variants)
src/components/layout/Header.astro
src/pages/index.astro
src/pages/projects/[...slug].astro
src/pages/stays/[...slug].astro
src/pages/contact.astro

```

---

## Final Principle

> **Add color when it solves a problem, not because you have colors available.**

Every color should:
1. Create clear hierarchy
2. Encourage the right action
3. Make the user's job easier

If you can't explain why a color is needed, wait until you can.
