## Section 4: Content & Reading (1-2 mins)

### Q9: Information Density
When browsing project or stay pages online, you typically:

- [ ] Read everything thoroughly before deciding
- [ ] Skim headlines and key points, read details if interested
- [ ] Look at photos first, then scan for key facts
- [ ] Jump straight to pricing and booking info
- [ ] Check location and trust signals, skip most text

### Q10: Location Information
How do you prefer to see location details (e.g., "Ubud, Bali, Indonesia")?

- [ ] As clickable tags/pills that let me find similar projects
- [ ] Written naturally in a sentence
- [ ] On an embedded map
- [ ] Multiple ways - tags AND map AND text
- [ ] Just text is fine

### Q11: Visual Design
When information is grouped in boxes or colored sections, what does that signal to you?

- [ ] Important information I should pay attention to
- [ ] Something I can click or interact with
