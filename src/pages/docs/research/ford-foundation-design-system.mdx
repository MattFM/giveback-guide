## Comparison to Giveback Guide

### Potential Inspirations

**What Could Work Well**:

1. **Bold hero sections**: Your homepage could benefit from larger, more impactful hero
2. **Card hover effects**: More pronounced hover states on project/stay cards
3. **Category/tag presentation**: Ford's clean pill-style tags are very readable
4. **Whitespace**: More generous spacing between sections
5. **Color blocking**: Occasional full-width colored sections for variety
6. **Mission-first headlines**: Bolder, more action-oriented language
7. **Collage imagery**: Could work well for impact stories or multiple projects

**What Wouldn't Work**:

1. **Corporate aesthetic**: Ford's design is more formal than Giveback's friendly vibe
2. **Limited color palette**: GBG benefits from more colorful, vibrant approach
3. **Heavy institutional feel**: GBG should feel more grassroots and accessible

### Implementation Ideas

1. **Enhanced card component**: Add Ford-style hover lift and image zoom
2. **Section dividers**: Full-width colored sections between major content areas
3. **Improved type hierarchy**: Larger headlines for more impact
4. **Newsletter signup**: Horizontal multi-field design like Ford's
5. **About sections**: Two-column image+text layouts for storytelling
6. **Priority/impact areas**: Grid layout similar to Ford's priority areas

## Questions for Implementation

Before borrowing from this design system, consider:

1. **Brand alignment**: Does Ford's more corporate/institutional aesthetic fit Giveback Guide's friendly, grassroots vibe?
2. **Color palette**: Should we adopt similar color relationships (teal + orange) or maintain GBG's existing palette?
3. **Typography scale**: How much larger should our headlines be?
4. **Spacing system**: Should we standardize spacing to match Ford's rhythm?
5. **Component complexity**: Which components provide the most value for the effort?
6. **Accessibility parity**: Are we already meeting the same accessibility standards?
